webb this is not about benghazi per se . to me it is the inevitability of something like benghazi occurring in the way that we intervened in libya . we had no treaties at risk . we had no americans at risk . there was no threat of attack or imminent attack . there is plenty of time for a president to come to the congress and request authority to use military force in that situation . i called for it on the senate floor again and again . i called for it in senate hearings . it is not a wise thing to do . and if people think it was a wise thing to do , try to get to the tripoli airport today . you can't do it . 
sanders because i'm not sure that the government should say is you are too big to fail . you've got to be a certain size . and , then the banks themselves can figure out what they want to sell off . i don't know that it's appropriate that the department of treasury to be making those decisions . what we need is to make sure that they are safe . 
sanders an interesting comment , but you didn't answer the question . 
clinton i put it out . . . 
o'malley . . . the only person on this stage who has . . . 
clinton in 2003 , i sponsored the dreamer act . i sponsored i think in every congress after that . i have been consistent and committed to comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship . i think our best chance was in 2007 , when ted kennedy led the charge on comprehensive immigration reform . we have republican support . we had a president willing to sign it . i voted for that bill . senator sanders voted against it . just think , imagine where we would be today is we had achieved comprehensive immigration reform nine years ago . imagine how much more secure families would be in our country , no longer fearing the deportation of a loved one ; no longer fearing that they would be found out . so i am staunchly in favor of comprehensive immigration reform and have been so over the course of my public career . 
sanders absolutely . of course . 
o'malley i am telling the truth . 
sanders . . . anderson , not only do we have a crumbling school system in detroit , and in many other areas , we have and everybody in this room should be embarrassed by this , we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth . that is a disgrace . so , when you ask me about my priorities , my priorities are that no , we're not going to give tax breaks to the wealthy . we're going to ask them to start paying their fair share of taxes so we can raise the money to make sure that every child in this country , in detroit , in vermont , gets the quality education that he or she deserves . 
sanders . . . let's talk about that . when you were secretary of state , you also worked hard to expand fracking to countries all over the world . cheering the issue here of course the agreement is a step forward , but you know agreements and i know agreements , there's a lot of paper there . we've got to get beyond paper right now . we have got to lead the world in transforming our energy system , not tomorrow , but yesterday . and , what that means , wolf , it means having the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry . now , i am on board legislation that says , you know what , we ain't going to excavate for fossil fuel on public land . that's not secretary clinton's position . 
clinton well , i think that there are different records . i you know , know that senator sanders had a different vote than i did when it came to giving immunity to gun makers and sellers . that was a terrible mistake . it basically gave the gun lobby even more power to intimidate legislators , not just in washington but across the country . but just think about this since we last debated in las vegas , nearly 3 , 000 people have been killed by guns . twenty one mass shootings , including one last weekend in des moins where three were murdered . two hundred children have been killed . this is an emergency . there are a lot of things we've got to do in our country , reigning in wall street is certainly one of them . i agree with that . that's why i've got such a good plan . but we have to also go after the gun lobby and 92 percent of americans agree we should have universal background checks . close the gun show loophole , close the online loophole and . . . 
clinton . . . my principles and the results that i get . 
clinton let me respond . . . 
clinton . . . voted for it . i'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people's lives . i've seen the results of what has happened in families and in communities . that's why i chose to make my very first speech a year ago on this issue , errol , because i want to focus the attention of our country and to make the changes we need to make . and i also want people . . . . . . especially i want i want white people i want white people to recognize that there is systemic racism . it's also in employment , it's in housing , but it is in the criminal justice system , as well . 
clinton . . . senator sanders , from a debate in 2008 , quote what i said . the question was , would you meet with an adversary without conditions ? i said no . and in fact , in obama administration , we did not meet with anybody without conditions . that is the appropriate approach in order to get the results that you are seeking . 
sanders as the secretary said , well , she will do it if other people do it . i will do it . i didn't give any speeches , there is no transcript . 
o'malley look , i look at our economy as an ecosystem . and the fact of the matter is that the more fully people participate , the more our workers earn , the more they will spend , the more our economy will grow . and most heads of businesses large , medium and small understand that . but there is a better way forward than either of those offered by my two opponents here on this stage . we're not going to fix what ails our economy , we're not going to make wages go up for everyone by either trying to replace american capitalism with socialism which , by the way , the rest of the world is moving away from nor will we fix it by submitting to sort of wall street directed crony capitalism . and for my part , i have demonstrated the ability to have the backbone to take on wall street in ways that secretary clinton never , ever has . in fact , in the last debate , very shamefully , she tried to hide her cozy relationship with wall street big banks by invoking the attacks of 9 11 . i believe that the way forward for our country is to actually reinvigorate our antitrust department with the directive to promote fair competition . there's mergers that are happening in every aspect of our country that is bad for competition and it's bad for for upward mobility of wages . and the worst type of concentration , secretary clinton , is the concentration of the big banks , the big six banks that you went to and spoke to and told them , oh , you weren't responsible for the crash , not by a long shot . and that's why today you still cannot support , as i do , breaking up the big banks and making sure that we pass a modern day glass steagall , like we had in late 1999 , before it was repealed and led to the crash , where so many millions of families lost their jobs and their homes . and i was on the front lines of that , looking into the eyes of my neighbors . . . 
sanders oh inaudible . laughter see , when you are old , then they go back all these years . all right . what have you got ? 
sanders absolutely , because what we will do is say , instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires , we are going to create millions of jobs for low income kids so they're not hanging out on street corners . we're going to make sure that those kids stay in school or are able to get a college education . and i think when you give low income kids african american , white , latino kids the opportunities to get their lives together , they are not going to end up in jail . they're going to end up in the productive economy , which is where we want them . 
sanders where the secretary and i have a very profound difference , in the last debate and i believe in her book very good book , by the way in her book and in this last debate , she talked about getting the approval or the support or the mentoring of henry kissinger . now , i find it rather amazing , because i happen to believe that henry kissinger was one of the most destructive secretaries of state in the modern history of this country . i am proud to say that henry kissinger is not my friend . i will not take advice from henry kissinger . and in fact , kissinger's actions in cambodia , when the united states bombed that country , overthrew prince sihanouk , created the instability for pol pot and the khmer rouge to come in , who then butchered some 3 million innocent people , one of the worst genocides in the history of the world . so count me in as somebody who will not be listening to henry kissinger . 
clinton . . . social security inaudible . . . 
sanders well , we're gonna win because first , we're gonna explain what democratic socialism is . and what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent almost own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent . that it is wrong , today , in a rigged economy , that 57 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent . that when you look around the world , you see every other major country providing health care to all people as a right , except the united states . you see every other major country saying to moms that , when you have a baby , we're not gonna separate you from your newborn baby , because we are going to have we are gonna have medical and family paid leave , like every other country on earth . those are some of the principles that i believe in , and i think we should look to countries like denmark , like sweden and norway , and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people . 
sanders . . . i am very glad that . . . crosstalk 
o'malley anderson , i actually have talked about a revolution . what we need is a green energy revolution . we need to move america to a 100 percent clean electric grid by 2050 and create 5 million jobs along the way . 
sanders let's talk aboutok , let's talk . . . 
sanders ok . one and i agree with what the secretary said , and what governor o'malley said . but here's an issue that we also should talk about . we have a 600 billion military budget . it is a budget larger than the next eight countries' . unfortunately , much of that budget continues to fight the old cold war with the soviet union . very little of that budget less than 10 percent actually goes into fighting isis and international terrorism . we need to be thinking hard about making fundamental changes in the priorities of the defense department . 
clinton look we have a lawlook , you know , ii appreciate the senator's advocacy . we have a law . it was passed . it was signed by president obama . it lays out a process that you go through to determine whether a systemic risk is posed . and by the way , president obama signed that , pushed it through , even though he took donations from wall street , because he's a responsible president . so we have a law in place . if the circumstances warrant it , i will certainly use it . and from what you say , i know you will as well . but that is not enough . and i keep going back to this because part of the reason the wall street guys are trying so hard to stop methe hedge fund guys , the shadow banking guysis because i've got their number on all of that . and my plan goes so much further to try to prevent the problems of the future . you know , we can't just fight the last war . we've got to be prepared to stop these guys if they ever try to use their economic power once again , to hurt the economy , and to hurt so many americans . and my plan , paul krugman , barney frank , a lot of experts who understand what the new challenges might be , have said i am exactly on point , and the wall street guys actually know that . crosstalk 
clinton . . . not taking a back seat to anybody on my values . . . 
sanders but what if we have . . . 
sanders well , first of all , karen , when you have republican candidates for president and in congress telling you that climate change is a hoax , which is donald trump and other candidates' position , what they are really saying is , we don't have the guts to take on the fossil fuel industry . what candidates are saying is if we stand up to the fossil fuel industry , and transform our energy system away from coal and oil and gas to energy efficiency and wind and solar and geothermal and other sustainable technologies , you know what happens to that republican who listens to the scientists ? on that day , that republican loses his campaign funding from the koch brothers and the fossil fuel industry . 
sanders well . . . 
sanders well , let's understand that when we talk about syria , you're talking about a quagmire in a quagmire . you're talking about groups of people trying to overthrow assad , other groups of people fighting isis . you're talking about people who are fighting isis using their guns to overthrow assad , and vice versa . i'm the former chairman of the senate veterans committee , and in that capacity i learned a very powerful lesson about the cost of war , and i will do everything that i can to make sure that the united states does not get involved in another quagmire like we did in iraq , the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country . we should be putting together a coalition of arab countries who should be leading the effort . we should be supportive , but i do not support american ground troops in syria . 
sanders . . . no , i don't . i worry very , very much about an isolated country . that's what makes me nervous . russia lives in the world . china lives in the world . north korea is a very , very strange country because it is so isolated , and i do feel that a nation with nuclear weapons , they have got to be dealt with . dealt with effectively . 
clinton on the issue of wall street . 
sanders let me agree with governor o'malley and let me agree with secretary clinton . you know , we had this incident before , secretary , with your famous e mails . right ? and what i said and i think what governor o'malley is saying , and i hope you say , is when the middle class of this country is disappearing , when we have massive income and wealth inequality , when we're the only major country on earth not guaranteeing health care to all people , all the issues that the governor talked about , the secretary talked about , those are the issues . media notwithstanding . those are the issues that the american people want discussed . i hope those are the issues we'll discuss . 
o'malley andrea , i need to talk about homeland security and preparedness . ever since the attacks of september 11th 30 seconds . laughter ever since the attacks of september 11th , my colleagues , democratic and republican mayors , democratic and republican governors , made me their leader on homeland security and preparedness . here in the homeland , unlike combating isil abroad , we're almost like it's your body's immune system . it's able to protect your body against bad bugs , not necessarily because it outnumbers them , but it's better connected the fusion centers , the biosurveillance systems , better prepared first responders . but there's another front in this battle , and it is this . that's the political front , and if donald trump wants to start a registry in our country of people by faith , he can start with me , and i will sign up as one who is totally opposed to his fascist appeals that wants to vilify american muslims . that can do more damage to our democracy than any . . . crosstalk 
sanders it is . 
sanders sure . 
clinton . . . no , that's not what . . . 
sanders . . . isis would be . . . 
clinton well , the last point on this is , senator sanders , you're the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial market in 2000 , to take the cops off the street , to use governor o'malley's phrase , to make the sec and the commodities futures trading commission no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives , which were one of the main cause of the collapse in '08 . so there's plenty . . . 
clinton look , i think we are readier than we used to be , but it's a constant effort that has to be undertaken to make sure we are as ready as we need to be . we have made a lot of improvements in our domestic security since 9 11 , and we have been able to foil and prevent attacks , yet we see the terrible attack in san bernardino and know that we haven't done enough . so we have to go after this both abroad and at home . we have to go after terrorist networks , predominantly isis that's not the only one , but let's focus on that for a minute . we have to lead a coalition that will take back territory from isis . that is principally an american led air campaign that we are now engaged in . we have to support the fighters on the ground , principally the arabs and the kurds who are willing to stand up and take territory back from raqqa to ramadi . we have to continue to work with the iraqi army so that they are better prepared to advance on some of the other strongholds inside iraq , like mosul , when they are able to do so . and we have to cut off the flow of foreign funding and foreign fighters . and we have to take on isis online . they are a sophisticated purveyor of propaganda , a celebrator of violence , an instigator of attacks using their online presence . here at home , we've got to do a better job coordinating between federal , state , and local law enforcement . we need the best possible intelligence not only from our own sources , but from sources overseas , that can be a real time fusion effort to get information where it's needed . but the final thing i want to say about this is the following . you know , after 9 11 , one of the efforts that we did in new york was if you see something or hear something suspicious , report it . and we need to do that throughout the country . but we need to understand that american muslims are on the front line of our defense . they are more likely to know what's happening in their families and their communities , and they need to feel not just invited , but welcomed within the american society . so when somebody like donald trump and others . . . . . . stirs up the demagoguery against american muslims , that hurts us at home . it's not only offensive ; it's dangerous . and the same goes for overseas , where we have to put together a coalition of muslim nations . i know how to do that . i put together the coalition that imposed the sanctions on iran that got us to the negotiating table to put a lid on their nuclear weapons program . and you don't go tell muslim nations you want them to be part of a coalition when you have a leading candidate for president of the united states who insults their religion . so this has to be looked at overall , and we have to go at it from every possible angle . 
clinton well , let me just add that , you know , i've said this before and i'm very proud of it , that when it comes to judgment , having run a hard race against senator obama at the time , he turned to me to be secretary of state . and when it comes to the biggest counterterrorism issues that we faced in this administration , namely whether or not to go after bin laden , i was at that table , i was exercising my judgment to advise the president on what to do , on that , on iran , on russia on china , on a whole raft of issues . because i know from my own experience that you've got to be ready on day one . there is just too much unpredictable threat and danger in the world today , you know , to try to just say wait , i'll get to that when i can . that is just not an acceptable approach . 
clinton no . 
chafee ok . i just have to answer one thing that senator webb said about the iran deal , because i'm a strong proponent of what president obama and he said that because of that the iran deal that enabled russia to come in . no , that's not true , senator webb . i respect your foreign policy chops . but russia is aligned with iran and with assad and the alawite shias in syria . so that iran deal did not allow russia to come in . 
clinton first of all , please know how brave i think you are , coming here with your children to tell your story . this is an incredible act of courage that i'm not sure many people really understand . and i want you to know that in the work that i've done and the many families that i've met , i have heard similar stories like yours , where your husband is deported . your children's father is gone . you are doing your very best to support your children . but it is time to bring families together . and i don't think there's any doubt that we must do more to let stories like yours be heard more widely so that more americans know what the human cost of these policies are . and i will do everything i can to prevent other families from facing what you are facing . and i will do everything i can to pass laws that would bring families back together . and i hope that your children are all either citizens born in this country or eligible for the programs that president obama has put into place , daca and dapa , because i will defend those and i will absolutely protect your children , yourself , and try to bring your family back together . 
clinton well , you know , senator , i don't thinki don't . . . crosstalk 
sanders let me hear if there's any difference between the secretary and myself . i have voted time and again to for for the background check , and i want to see it improved and expanded . i want to see us do away with the gun show loophole . in 1988 , i lost an election because i said we should not have assault weapons on the streets of america . we have to do away with the strawman proposal . we need radical changes in mental health in america so somebody who is suicidal or homicidal can get the emergency care they need . we have i don't know that there's any disagreement here . . . 
sanders president sanders would fire anybody who knew about what was happening and did not act appropriately . and president sanders would make the point that , how does it happen , in the wealthiest country in the history of the world ? what are our priorities when , among others , republicans today are fighting for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest people ? how did we have so much money available to go to war in iraq and spend trillions of dollars . . . . . . but somehow not have enough money not just for flint , the secretary is right . there are communities all over this country it's not just infrastructure , it is education . detroit's public school system is collapsing . 
clinton . . . with the united nations in order to continue to try to support them . the libyan people deserve a chance at democracy and self government . and i , as president , will keep trying to give that to them 
sanders let me do that but let me pick up on an issue , a very important issue that we have not yet discussed . this nation is the most powerful military in the world . we're spending over 600 billion a year on the military and yet , significantly less than 10 percent of that money is used to be fighting international terrorism . we are spending hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining 5 , 000 nuclear weapons . i think we need major reform in the military , making it more cost effective , but also focusing on the real crisis that faces us . the cold war is over . and our focus has got to be on intelligence , increased manpower , fighting internationally targets . so , in terms of refugees , i believe that the united states has the moral responsibility with europe , with gulf countries like saudi arabia to make sure that when people leave countries like afghanistan and syria with nothing more than the clothing on their back that , of course , we reach out . now , what the magic number is , i don't know , because we don't know the extent of the problem . but i certainly think that the united states should take its full responsibility in helping those people . 
clinton well , i'm sorry that whoever tweeted that had that impression because i worked closely with new yorkers after 9 11 for my entire first term to rebuild . so , yes , i did know people . i've had a lot of folks give me donations from all kinds of backgrounds say , i don't agree with you on everything , but i like what you do . i like how you stand up . i'm going to support you , and i think that is absolutely appropriate . 
sanders inaudible . 
webb you got the lucky inaudible . 
o'malley well , i'll tell you what , i've said this before . i don't i believe that we actually need some new economic thinking in the white house . and i would not have robert rubin or larry summers , with all due respect , secretary clinton , to you and to them , back on my council of economic advisers . 
clinton i think it's i think it's important for people out there watching this tonight to know that i also have a considerable lead in pledged delegates . and my lead in pledged delegates is actually wider than barack obama's lead was over me . and in addition to winning states in the deep south , we won florida , texas , arizona , massachusetts , ohio , illinois , north carolina , missouri . and so i think where we stand today is that we are in this campaign very confident and optimistic , but it all comes down to reaching every single voter . i'm not taking anything for granted or any voter or any place . so i'm going to work my heart out here in new york until the polls close on tuesday . i'm going to work in pennsylvania , connecticut , rhode island , delaware and maryland , all the way through california . and when we end up with the number of delegates we need , we will unite the party and have a unified convention . . . 
clinton well , let me start by saying we need to talk about this issue and we should talk about it in terms of the extraordinary threats that climate change pose to our country and our world . and that's why for the last many years , both in the senate and as secretary of state , it's been a big part of my commitment to see what could be done . but there has never been any doubt that when i was a senator , i tried i joined with others to try to get rid of the subsidies for big oil . and i have proposed that again , because that's what i think needs to be done as we transition from fossil fuels to clean energy . and everyone who's looked at this independently , the washington post and others , who give us both hard times when called for on facts , have said that this is absolutely an incorrect false charge . so , we both have relatively small amounts of contributions from people who work for fossil fuel companies . best we can tell from the reports that are done . but , that is not being supported by big oil , and i think it's important to distinguish that . and , let's talk about what each of us has proposed to try to combat greenhouse gas emissions and put us on the fastest track possible to clean energy . 
o'malley yes , let's talk about this . when i ran for mayor in 1999 , lester , it was not because our city was doing well . it was because we were burying over 300 young , poor black men every single year . and that's why i ran , because , yes , black lives matter . and we did a number of things . we weren't able to make our city immune from setbacks as the freddie gray unrest and tragic death showed . but we were able to save a lot of lives doing things that actually worked to improve police and community relations . the truth of the matter is , we created a civilian review board . and many of these things are in the new agenda for criminal justice reform that i've put forward . we created a civilian review board , gave them their own detectives . we required the reporting of discourtesy , use of excessive force , lethal force . i repealed the possession of marijuana as a crime in our state . i drove our incarceration rate down to 20 year lows , and drove violent crime down to 30 year lows , and became the first governor south of the mason dixon line to repeal the death penalty . i feel a responsibility every day to find things that work . . . 
clinton well , i know journalists have asked who you do listen to on foreign policy , and we have yet to know who that is . 
clinton so this is the kind of approach that we should take in dealing with what is now . . . 
clinton well , i don't agree with that , because we will not get the support on the ground in syria to dislodge isis if the fighters there who are not associated with isis , but whose principal goal is getting rid of assad , don't believe there is a political , diplomatic channel that is ongoing . we now have that . we have the u . n . security council adopting a resolution that lays out a transition path . it's very important we operate on both at the same time . and let me just say a word about coalition building , because i've heard senator sanders say this . i know how hard it is to build coalitions . i think it would be a grave mistake to ask for any more iranian troops inside syria . that is like asking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire . the iranians getting more of a presence in syria , linking with hezbollah , their proxy in lebanon , would threaten israel and would make it more difficult for us to move on a path to have a transition that at some point would deal with assad's future . crosstalk 
o'malley oh , yes there is . laughter 
sanders yeah . 
clinton i don't well , i don't know how high it goes . i would certainly be launching an investigation . i think there is one . i was told that you know , some of the higher ups were pushing to get changes that were not happening . so i would have a full investigation , determine who knew what , when . and yes , people should be fired . how far up it went , i don't know . but as far as it goes , they should be relieved , because they failed this city . but let me just add this , anderson . this is not the only place where this kind of action is needed . we have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water , including lead , are way above what anybody should tolerate . we have a higher rate of tested lead in people in cleveland than in flint . so i'm not satisfied with just doing everything we must do for flint . i want to tackle this problem across the board . and if people know about it and they're not acting , and they're in the government at any level , they should be forced to resign . 
clinton we are mixing apples and oranges . my 750 , 000 donors have contributed more than a million and a half donations . i'm very proud . that , i think , between the two of us demonstrates the strength of the support we have among people who want to see change in our country . but , the real issue , i think , that the senator is injecting into this is that if you had a super pac , like president obama has , which now says it wants to support me . it's not my pac . if you take donations from wall street , you can't be independent . i would just say , i debated then senator obama numerous times on stages like this , and he was the recipient of the largest number of wall street donations of anybody running on the democratic side ever . now , when it mattered , he stood up and took on wall street . he pushed through , and he passed the dodd frank regulation , the toughest regulations since the 1930's . so , let's not in anyway imply here that either president obama or myself , would in anyway not take on any vested interested , whether it's wall street , or drug companies , or insurance companies , or frankly , the gun lobby to stand up to do what's best for the american people . 
clinton dana , you know i love being in brooklyn . cheering and applause dana , let me add here that there are two ways to at this under dodd frank , which is after all the law we passed under president obama , and i'm proud that barney frank , one of the authors , has endorsed me because what i have said continuously is , yes , sometimes the government may have to order certain actions . sometime the government can permit the institution themselves to take those actions . that has to be the judgement of the regulators . but , there's another element to this . i believe strongly that executives of any of these organizations should be financially penalized if there is a settlement . they should have to pay up through compensation or bonuses because we have to go after not just the big giant institution , we have got to go after the people who are making the decisions in the institutions . 
chafee no , no . as long as you're getting a warrant , i believe that under the fourth amendment , you should be able to do surveillance , but you need a warrant . that's what the fourth amendment says . and in the patriot act , section 215 started to get broadened too far . so i would be in favor of addressing and reforming section 215 of the patriot act . 
sanders let me just say this , while we are on wall street , one of us has a super pac . one of us has raised 15 million from wall street for that super pac . one of us has given speeches on wall street for hundreds of thousands of dollars . now , i kind of think if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech , it must be a great speech . i think we should release it and let the american people see what that transcript was . 
clinton yes , i'm getting . . . 
sanders . . . excuse me , i think i'm responding now . 
o'malley john , thank you , and to all of the people in iowa , for the role you have performed in this presidential selection process . if you believe that our country's problems and the threats that we face in this world can only be met with new thinking , new and fresh approaches , then i ask you to join my campaign . go on to martinomalley . com . no hour is too short , no dollar too small . if you we will not solve our nation's problems by resorting to the divisive ideologies of our past , or by returning to polarizing figures from our past . we are at the threshold of a new era of american progress , but it's going to require that we act as americans , based on our principles , here at home , making an economy that works for all of us . and , also , acting according to our principles and constructing a new foreign policy of engagement and collaboration , and doing a much better job of identifying threats before they back up into military corners . there is no challenge too great for the united states to confront , provided we have the ability and the courage to put forward new leadership that can move us to those better and safer and more prosperous days . i need your help . thank you very , very much . 
sanders this has been a wonderful debate , but time being limited , some of the most important issues facing our country have not been asked . and that is , is it acceptable that in america the top 0 . 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent . is it acceptable that while the average american works longer hours for lower wages , 58 percent of all new income is going to the top 1 percent . is it acceptable that wall street and billionaires are spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy elections ? is that democracy or this that oligarchy ? which is why i believe we've got to overturn citizens united and move to public funding of elections . is it right that in the greatest , wealthiest country in the history of the world , so many of our young people can't even afford to go to college or leave school deeply in debt , in the wealthiest country in the history of the world ? if we stand up , fight back , we can do a lot better . that's why i'm running for president . 
o'malley i believe there are many issues . i have 60 seconds for this ? 
sanders well , i think the best answer i don't know that i can give you a definitive answer here , but i will give you this answer . when i was a young man at the university of chicago , i worked with fellow black and white students trying to desegregate the university of chicago owned housing . most candidates for president , don't put this on their resume , but i was arrested by the chicago police for trying to desegregate the chicago school system . in 1963 , and an important day for me , i went to the march on washington led by dr . king for jobs and freedom . dr . king has been an important inspiration for me . in this campaign , if you go toberniesanders . com and read our position on criminal justice , it is i believe the strongest position of any candidate . what it says among other things , 51 percent of african american kids today are unemployed you know we're going to do ? we're going to provide education and jobs for those kids , not jails or incarceration . 
sanders first , dana . . . 
sanders . . . both in nicaragua and cuba . look , let's look at the facts here . cuba is , of course , an authoritarian undemocratic country , and i hope very much as soon as possible it becomes a democratic country . but on the other hand . . . . . . on the other hands , it would be wrong not to state that in cuba they have made some good advances in health care . they are sending doctors all over the world . they have made some progress in education . i think by restoring full diplomatic relations with cuba , it will result in significant improvements to the lives of cubans and it will help the united states and our business community invest . 
sanders right . what we have got to do there is , among other things , as i was just saying , have silicon valley help us to make sure that information being transmitted through the internet or in other ways by isis is , in fact , discovered . but i do believe we can do that without violating the constitutional and privacy rights of the american people . crosstalk 
clinton . . . and they sell products all the time that cause harm . . . 
clinton . . . but it goes much further , because . . . 
sanders well , look . . . 
o'malley i believe that now that we're finally having debates , anderson , that we don't have to be defined by the email scandal , and how long what the fbi's asking about . instead , we can talk about affordable college , making college debt free , and all the issues . which is why and i see the chair of the dnc here , look how glad we are actually to be talking about the issues that matter the most to people around the kitchen table . we need to get wages to go up , college more affordable . . . 
clinton well , john , look , i think that what happened when we abided by the agreement that george w . bush made with the iraqis to leave by 2011 , is that an iraqi army was left that had been trained and that was prepared to defend iraq . unfortunately , nouri al maliki , the prime minister , set about decimating it . and then , with the revolution against assad and i did early on say we needed to try to find a way to train and equip moderates very early so that we would have a better idea of how to deal with assad because i thought there would be extremist groups filling the vacuum . so , yes , this has developed . i think that there are many other reasons why it has in addition to what happened in the region , but i don't think that the united states has the bulk of the responsibility . i really put that on assad and on the iraqis and on the region itself . 
clinton well , thank you very much for a lively debate . and i appreciate greatly all the questions , especially the questions in person from the people here and those coming at us from facebook . it just reinforces my strong commitment to do everything i can to break down all the barriers that stand in the way of people living up to their own potential , and of our country doing the same . so i am going to take on those economic barriers . i have a plan to create jobs and raise incomes . i'm going to take on the education barriers that often leave too many children behind even after they have completed schooling . i'm going to take on the healthcare barriers . i'm going to do everything i can to make sure that we unite our country . i will find common ground , just as i have as first lady , as senator and secretary of state . i will also stand my ground wherever matters of principles are at stake . i would be honored to have your support in the upcoming primary on tuesday , and hope to have the great honor of serving you as your president . 
sanders and let me just say this . as secretary clinton may know , i am on the health education labor committee . that committee wrote the affordable care act . the idea i would dismantle health care in america while we're waiting to pass a medicare for all is just not accurate . the affordable care act has clearly , as secretary clinton made the point , done a lot of good things , but , what it has not done is dealt with the fact we have 29 million people today who have zero health insurance , we have even more who are underinsured with large deductibles and copayments and prescription drug prices are off the wall . so i do believe that in the future , not by dismantling what we have herei helped write that billbut by moving forward , rallying the american people , i do believe we should have health care for all . 
sanders yeah . 
clinton exact same thing . 
clinton well , you can tell , dana , he cannot come up with any example , because there is no example . it is important it's always important . it may be inconvenient , but it's always important to get the facts straight . i stood up against the behaviors of the banks when i was a senator . i called them out on their mortgage behavior . i also was very willing to speak out against some of the special privileges they had under the tax code . when i went to the secretary of state office , the president president obama led the effort to pass the dodd frank bill . that is the law . now , this is our ninth debate . in the prior eight debates , i have said , we have a law . you don't just say , we're upset about this . i'm upset about it . you don't just say , go break them up . you have a law , because we are a nation of laws . 
sanders let me tell my story . you tell yours . 
clinton . . . i don't think you could find any person in political life today who has been subjected to more attacks and had more money spent against her by special interests , among whom you have named a few , than i . and i'm proud of that . you know , when i took on the drug companies and the insurance companies for universal health care coverage , they went after me with a vengeance . today , you've got hedge fund billionaires aligned with karl rove , running ads against me to try to get democrats to vote for you . i know this game . i'm going to stop this game . but while we're talking about votes , you're the one who voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives in 2000 , which contributed to the over leveraging of lehman brothers , which was one of the culprits that brought down the economy . so i don't knowi'm not impugning your motive because you voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives . people make mistakes and i'm certainly not saying you did it for any kind of financial advantage . what we've got to do as democratswhat we've got to do as democrats is to be united to actually solve these problems . and what i believe is that i have a better track record and a better opportunity to actually get that job done . that's what this election should be about . 
clinton 
clinton that is exactly . . . 
o'malley can i get 30 seconds , too ? laughter 
clinton you know what i have told my friends at the top of both unions , we've got take a look at this because it is one of the most common criticisms . we need to eliminate the criticism . you know , teachers do so much good , they are often working under most difficult circumstances . so anything that could be changed , i want them to look at it . i will be a good partner to make sure that whatever i can do as president , i will do to support the teachers of our country . 
clinton . . . well , what about the greed and recklessness of gun manufacturers and dealers in america ? cheering and applause 
chafee yes , i have a good record of voting for gun commonsense safety legislation , but the reality is , despite these tragedies that happen time and time again , when legislators step up to pass commonsense gun safety legislation , the gun lobby moves in and tells the people they're coming to take away your guns . and , they're successful at it , in colorado and others states , the legislators that vote for commonsense gun safety measures then get defeated . i even saw in rhode island . so , i would bring the gun lobby in and say we've got to change this . where can we find common ground ? wayne lapierre from the nra , whoever it is , the leaders . come one , we've go to change this . we're not coming to take away your guns , we believe in the second amendment , but let's find common ground here . 
clinton thank you very much . i've been looking forward to this debate , and i want to thank univision , the washington post , facebook and miami dade college , the largest college in north america for hosting us here this evening . and tonight i am looking forward to the opportunity to discuss how we knock down the barriers that stand in the way of people getting ahead and staying ahead , starting with the economic ones . my focus is on more good paying jobs with rising incomes for families and how we prevent corporations from taking jobs out of our country by imposing an exit tax , making them pay back any tax breaks they've gotten . but we also need to be having a positive agenda for manufacturing . for small businesses and entrepreneurs , for more clean energy jobs . and i also look forward to discussing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship that will be one of my priorities in my first 100 days as president . and i will also be talking about education , every child deserves a good teacher and a good school . 
sanders because of what i believe in what i was just saying . the democratic party needs major reform . to those of you in south carolina , you know what , in mississippi , we need a 50 state strategy so that people in south carolina and mississippi can get the resources that they need . instead of being dependent on super pacs , what we need is to be dependent on small , individual campaign contributors . we need an agenda that speaks to the needs of working families and low income people . not wealthy campaign contributors . 
clinton let me just conclude by saying that united farm workers considered that bill in their words the last best hope for farm workers and immigrants . they have proven to be right in the succeeding years . i only hope that we can put together a coalition to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next congress . and as i said earlier , in 2006 , senator sanders supported indefinite detention for people facing deportation . . . 
clinton yes . 
chafee the glass steagall was my very first vote , i'd just arrived , my dad had died in office , i was appointed to the office , it was my very first vote . 
clinton if i could just respond . two points . one , senator sanders voted in 1998 on what i think is fair to call a regime change resolution with respect to iraq , calling for the end of saddam hussein's regime . he voted in favor of regime change with libya , voted in favor of the security council being an active participate in setting the parameters for what we would do , which of course we followed through on . i do not believe a vote in 2002 is a plan to defeat isis in 2016 . it's very important we focus on the threats we face today , and that we understand the complicated and dangerous world we are in . when people go to vote in primaries or caucuses , they are voting not only for the president , they are voting for the commander in chief . and it's important that people really look hard at what the threats and dangers we face are , and who is best prepared for dealing with them . as we all remember , senator obama , when he ran against me , was against the war in iraq . and yet when he won , he turned to me , trusting my judgment , my experience , to become secretary of state . i was very honored to be asked to do that and very honored to serve with him those first four years . 
sanders you gave a major speech to aipac , which obviously deals with the middle east crisis , and you barely mentioned the palestinians . and i think , again , it is a complicated issue and god knows for decades presidents , including president clinton and others , jimmy carter and others have tried to do the right thing . all that i am saying is we cannot continue to be one sided . there are two sides to the issue . 
sanders we need to expand what the input into the democratic party . i am very proud that in this campaign , we have seen an enormous amount of excitement from young people , from working people . we have received more individual contributions than any candidate in the history of this country up to this point . 
sanders let me just just say this . for a start , the secretary and i disagree and i think the president does not agree with her in terms of the concept of a no fly zone in syria . i think you do have a humanitarian tragedy there , as i mentioned a moment ago . i applaud secretary kerry and the president for trying to put together this agreement . let's hope that it holds . but furthermore , what we have got to do , i'm sorry , yes , i do believe that we have got to do everything that we can , and it will not happen tomorrow . but i do hope that in years to come , just as occurred with cuba , 10 , 20 years ago , people would say , reach normalized relations with cuba . and by the way , i hope we can end the trade embargo with cuba as well . but the idea that we some day maybe have decent relations with iran , maybe put pressure on them so they end their support for terrorism around the world , yes , that is something i want to achieve . and i believe that the best way to do that is to be aggressive , to be principled , but to have the goal of trying to improve relations . that's how you make peace in the world . you sit down and you work with people , you make demands of people , in this case demanding iran stop the support of international terrorism . 
sanders . . . who control economic and political life of this country . 
clinton i can only say that we both share the goal of universal health care coverage . you know , before it was called obamacare , it was called hillarycare . and i took on the drug companies and i took on the insurance companies to try to get us universal health care coverage . and why i am a staunch supporter of president obama's principal accomplishment namely the affordable care act is because i know how hard it was to get that done . we are at 90 percent coverage . we have to get the remaining 10 . i've set forth very specific plans about how to get costs down , especially prescription drug costs . and it is difficult to in any way argue with the goal that we both share . but i think the american people deserve to know specifically how this would work . if it's medicare for all , then you no longer have the affordable care act , because the affordable care act , as you know very well , is based on the insurance system , based on exchanges , based on a subsidy system . the children's health insurance program , which i helped to create , which covers 8 million kids , is also a different kind of program . so if you're having medicare for all , single payer , you need to level with people about what they will have at the end of the process you are proposing . and based on every analysis that i can find by people who are sympathetic to the goal , the numbers don't add up , and many people will actually be worse off than they are right now . 
clinton let me go answer mr . mcghee's question because i think it's a profound one . i think the most important that happened to me was a combination of my church and youth minister when i was a teenager , insisting that we go in to inner city chicago because i lived in a suburb and have exchanges with kids in black and hispanic churches . it was also important for me to be a baby sitter for the children of migrant workers and to learn more about their lives , and to hear dr . king speak in chicago when i was about 14 years old . that got me thinking about what i needed to do to try to fulfill my faith . when i was in law school , i had the opportunity to mead a visionary woman , named mary right adelman , who worked with dr . king who was the first african american woman who passed the mississippi bar . i asked her for a job and she said she didn't have any money . i was working my way through law school and she said if i could get a job and get myself paid , she would give me a job . so i got law students a civil rights research council grant . the first thing she did was send me to look at south carolina , to investigate juveniles being sent to adult jails . the second thing she did was to send me to alabama to investigate segregated academies . so from that moment until today , i am so grateful for my experiences as a very young woman driven by my church and my experiences working for the children's defense fund which have given me some insight and have lit a fire inside me to do everything i can to address systemic racism . 
sanders here is where we are with public education . a 100 , 150 years ago incredibly brave americans said , you know what , working class kids , low income kids should not have to work in factories or on the farms . like rich kids , they deserve to get a free education . and that free education of extraordinary accomplishment was from first grade to 12th grade . the world has changed . this is 2016 . in many ways , a college degree today is equivalent to what a high school degree was 50 , 60 years ago . so , yes , i do believe that when we talk about public education in america , today , in a rapidly changing world , we should have free tuition at public colleges and universities . that should be a right of all americans regardless of the income of their families . 
clinton well , first of all i am looking at your daughter and i'm very grateful that she is laughing and she is on a road to recovery . but it never should have happened . you know , on average , 90 people a day are killed by gun violence in our country . i think we have to try everything that works to try to limit the numbers of people and the kinds of people who are given access to firearms . the brady bill , which has been in effect now for about 23 years , has kept more than two million purchases from going forward . so we do have to continue to try to work on that because not every killer will have the same profile . but the comprehensive background checks , closing the gun show loophole , closing the online loophole , closing what's called the charleston loophole , where you get a gun at the end of three days , even if the background check is not completed which is what the killer in charleston did . and then they found out later , he shouldn't have gotten the gun when he killed nine people at mother emmanuel church . i also believe , so strongly gene , that giving immunity to gunmakers and sellers was a terrible mistake . because it removed any accountability from the makers and the sellers . and it also disrupted what was a very promising legal theory , to try to get makers to do more to make guns safer for example . to try to give sellers more accountability for selling guns when they shouldn't have . so that is an issue that senator sanders and i differ on , i voted against giving them immunity , but i think we should very seriously move to repeal that and go back to making sure gun makers and sellers are like any other business . they can be held accountable . and then i do think we have got to have a public . . . 
clinton . . . yes , i did . 
o'malley yes . anderson , i want to associate myself with many of the items that the senator from vermont mentioned , and i actually did them in our state . we raised the minimum wage , passed the living wage , invested more in infrastructure , went four years in a row without a penny's increase in college tuition . but there's another piece that senator sanders left out tonight , but he's been excellent about underscoring that . and that is that we need to separate the casino , speculative , mega bank gambling that we have to insure with our money , from the commercial banking namely , reinstating glass steagall . secretary clinton mentioned my support eight years ago . and secretary , i was proud to support you eight years ago , but something happened in between , and that is , anderson , a wall street crash that wiped out millions of jobs and millions of savings for families . and we are still just as vulnerable paul volcker says today . we need to reinstate glass steagall and that's a huge difference on this stage among us as candidates . 
sanders just in this . i am not sure which legislation that was . but i think it may have been the welfare reform , so called . . . 
sanders well , i think secretary clinton knows that what she says is very disingenuous . i have a d minus voting record from the nra . i was in 1988 , there were three candidates running for congress in the state of vermont , i stood up to the gun lobby and came out and maintained the position that in this country we should not be selling military style assault weapons . i have supported from day one and instant background check to make certain that people who should have guns do not have guns . and that includes people of criminal backgrounds , people who are mentally unstable . i support what president obama is doing in terms of trying to close the gun show loop holes and i think it should be a federal crime if people act as dormant . we have seen in this city a horrendous tragedy of a crazed person praying with people in the coming up and shooting nine people . this should not be a political issue . what we should be doing is working together . and by the way , as a senator from a rural state that has virtually no gun control , i believe that i am in an excellent position to bring people together to fight the sensible . . . 
sanders . . . that was one of the nice things that he said about me . laughter i'll tell you something , this is my right arm . i'm prepared to give no , i shouldn't say that . i would love to run against donald trump , and i'll tell you why . for a start , but almost not all , but almost every poll has shown that sanders versus trump does a lot better than clinton versus trump . right here in michigan there was a poll done , i think yesterday , or today , had me beating trump in michigan by 22 points . secretary clinton beat him as well , but not by so much . and , that's true nationally , and in many other states . and , the other reason i think we can beat trump is that our campaign is generating an enormous amount of excitement . just in the last two days we have won the caucuses in maine , we won that tonight with a very large turnout . applause and cheering we won nebraska , we won kansas , and kansas was the biggest turnout in their caucus history . i think we are exciting working class people , young people who are prepared to stand up and demand that we have a government that represents all of us . 
clinton . . . wait , wait . . . 
sanders look , we are fighting for every vote that we can get from women , from men , straight , gay , african americans , latinos , asian americans . we are trying to bring america together around an agenda that works for working families and the middle class . i am very proud , if my memory is not correct i think i am that i have a lifetime and i've been in congress a few years a lifetime 100 percent pro choice voting record . i am very proud that over the years we have had the support in my state of vermont from very significant majorities of women . i'm very proud that i support legislation that is currently in the congress , got support of almost all progressive democrats in the house and senate , which says we will end the absurdity of women today making 79 cents on the dollar compared to men . and we will join the rest of the other the industrialized world in saying that paid family and medical leave should be a right of all working families . 
sanders . . . we need to take a very hard look at our . . . 
clinton . . . let's get to 100 percent coverage , let's get the cost down , and let's guarantee health care . 
sanders . . . let me , if i may just briefly say something . . . 
sanders well , gwen and judy , thank you very much for hosting this event . and , pbs , thank you . nine months ago , our campaign began . and when it began , we had no political organization , no money , and not much name recognition outside of the state of vermont . a lot has happened in nine months . and what has happened is , i think , the american people have responded to a series of basic truths , and that is that we have today a campaign finance system which is corrupt , which is undermining american democracy , which allows wall street and billionaires to pour huge sums of money into the political process to elect the candidates of their choice . and aligned with a corrupt campaign finance system is a rigged economy . and that's an economy where ordinary americans are working longer hours for low wagers . they are worried to death about the future of their kids . and yet they are seeing almost all new income and all new wealth going to the top 1 percent . and then in addition to that , the american people are looking around and they see a broken criminal justice system . they see more people in jail in the united states of america than any other country on earth , 2 . 2 million . we're spending 80 billion a year locking up fellow americans . they see kids getting arrested for marijuana , getting in prison , getting a criminal record , while they see executives on wall street who pay billions of dollars in settlements and get no prosecution at all . no criminal records for them . i think what our campaign is indicating is that the american people are tired of establishment politics , tired of establishment economics . they want a political revolution in which millions of americans stand up , come together , not let the trumps of the world divide us , and say , you know what , in this great country , we need a government that represents all of us , not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors . thank you . 
sanders i have never heard a candidate never , who has received huge amounts of money from oil , from coal , from wall street , from the military industrial complex , not one candidate say , oh , these campaign contributions will not influence me . i'm going to be independent . well , why do they make millions of dollars of campaign contributions ? they expect to get something . everybody knows that . once again , i am running a campaign differently than any other candidate . we are relying on small campaign donors , 750 , 000 of them , 30 bucks a piece . that's who i'm indebted to . 
o'malley i would follow through on the promise that the american people thought we made as democratic party , to protect the main street economy from recklessness on wall street . i would push to separate out these too big to jail , too big to fail banks , and put in place glass steagall , a modern glass steagall that creates a firewall so that this wreckage of our economy can never happen again . 
sanders do i consider myself part of the casino capitalist process by which so few have so much and so many have so little by which wall street's greed and recklessness wrecked this economy ? no , i don't . i believe in a society where all people do well . not just a handful of billionaires . 
o'malley finally i'm sorry , that was second , lester . and third and finally , we need a new agenda for america's cities . we have not had a new agenda for america's cities since jimmy carter . we need a new agenda for america cities that will invest in the talents and skills in our people , that will invest in cbvg transportation , infrastructure and transit options , and make our cities the leading edge in this move to a redesigned built clean green energy future that will employ our people . 
sanders i think as secretary clinton knows , there is nobody who fought harder . i was on the house financial committee at that time . i heard the arguments coming from democrats and republicansrobert rubin , alan greenspanabout great an idea it would be if we did away with glass steagall and if we allowed investor banks and commercial banks and big insurance companies to merge . go to youtube today . look up greenspan sanders . listen to what i told them then . i helped lead the effort against deregulation . unfortunately , we lost that . the result iswas the worst financial disaster since the great depression . 
sanders kathie , let me say this . you know , no public policy doesn't have , in some cases , negative consequences . but at the end of the day , what you have right now are millions of americans working two or three jobs because their wages that they are earning are just too low . real inflation accounted for wages has declined precipitously over the years . so i believe that , in fact , this country needs to move towards a living wage . it is not a radical idea to say that if somebody works 40 hours a week , that person should not be living in poverty . it is not a radical idea to say that a single mom should be earning enough money to take care of her kids . so i believe that over the next few years , not tomorrow , but over the next few years , we have got to move the minimum wage to a living wage , 15 bucks an hour . and i apologize to nobody for that . 
sanders well , let me respond . secretary clinton , you just heard her , everybody else does it , she'll do it . i will do it . i am going to release all of the transcripts of the speeches that i gave on wall street behind closed doors , not for 225 , 000 , not for 2 , 000 , not for two cents . there were no speeches . and second of all , of course we will release our taxes . jane does our taxes . we've been a little bit busy lately . you'll excuse us . but we will . . . 
sanders but secretary clinton is wrong . as you know , because i know you know a lot about health care . you know that the united states per capita pays far and away more than other country . and it is unfair simply to say how much more the program will cost without making sure that people know that , we are doing away with cost of private insurance and that the middle class will be paying substantially less for health care on the single payer than on the secretary's clinton proposal . 
sanders the truth is , and you can speak to my colleagues , we have raised millions of dollars to the dscc . i have written letter that have raised , if i may use the word , huge amount of money so that's just not accurate . but , i will also say , and this is important and maybe the secretary disagrees with me , but i am proud that millions of young people who previously were not involved in the political process are now coming into it , and i do believe , i do believe that we have got to open the door of the democratic party to those people . and , i think the future of the democratic party is not simply by raising money from wealthy campaign contributors . i think that the way we are doing it in this campaign . . . 
clinton my plan would support any state that takes that position , and would work with those states and encourage more states to do the same thing . 
clinton and we have to lead , if we're going to be successful . 
clinton and , i know something about that . . . 
clinton . . . yes , of course they should be paying more , but that doesn't mean if they don't we leave , because i don't think that's in america's interests . 
o'malley i think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on wall street . . . 
o'malley i have to talk about something that's actually working in our state . 
o'malley lester , just ten seconds . 
clinton your proposal is to go and send the health care system to the state . 
clinton no , not at all . i think that we have to look at the fact that we lose 90 people a day from gun violence . this has gone on too long and it's time the entire country stood up against the nra . the majority of our country . . . . . . supports background checks , and even the majority of gun owners do . senator sanders did vote five times against the brady bill . since it was passed , more than 2 million prohibited purchases have been prevented . he also did vote , as he said , for this immunity provision . i voted against it . i was in the senate at the same time . it wasn't that complicated to me . it was pretty straightforward to me that he was going to give immunity to the only industry in america . everybody else has to be accountable , but not the gun manufacturers . and we need to stand up and say enough of that . we're not going to let it continue . 
sanders well , neil , i think we've got to work on a two pronged approach . and your point is absolutely well taken . the cost of college education is escalating a lot faster than the cost of inflation . there are a lot of factors involved in that . and that is that we have some colleges and universities that are spending a huge amount of money on fancy dormitories and on giant football stadiums . maybe we should focus on quality education with well paid faculty members . but . . . 
sanders 
paul this is what's wrong ! 
trump you looking at me ? 
bush donald donald's wrong on this . he is absolutely wrong on this . we're not going to be the world's policeman , but we sure as heck better be the world's leader . that's there's a huge difference where , without us leading . . . cheering . . . voids are filled , and the idea that it's a good idea for putin to be in syria , let isis take out assad , and then putin will take out isis ? i mean , that's like a board game , that's like playing monopoly or something . that's not how the real world works . we have to lead , we have to be involved . we should have a no fly zone in syria . there are they are barrel bombing the innocents in that country . if you're a christian , increasingly in lebanon , or iraq , or syria , you're going to be beheaded . and , if you're a moderate islamist , you're not going to be able to survive either . we have to play a role in this be able to bring the rest of the world to this issue before it's too late . 
fiorina . . . jake . . . 
cruz in spanish . 
walker well , first off , let's remember . i still remember , as a kid , tying a yellow ribbon around a tree in front of my house during the 444 days that iran held 52 americans hostage . iran is not a place we should be doing business with . to me , you terminate the deal on day one , you reinstate the sanctions authorized by congress , you go to congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place , and then you convince our allies to do the same . this is not just bad with iran , this is bad with isis . it is tied together , and , once and for all , we need a leader who's gonna stand up and do something about it . it's yet another example of the failed foreign policy of the obama clinton doctrine . 
walker first of all , i got to say to carson , huckabee , thanks a lot for making the rest of us look like chumps up here , but , i'd pick clara barton . i once worked for the american red cross , she was a great founder of the red cross . 
trump that's false . 
cruz . . . on defeating our enemies . so , for example . . . 
paul before we get a little bit off kilter here . . . 
bush here's the lessons of history when we we pull back , voids are created . we left iraq . we should've had a a forces agreement to stay there with a small force , and instead of that , we politically and militarily pulled back , and now we have the creation of isis . 36 days ago in this very library , i gave a speech with a comprehensive strategy how to take out isis , and it requires american leadership and engagement . we don't have to be the world's policemen . but we certainly have to be the world's leader . we need to have make sure that the world knows that we're serious , that we're engaged , that we're not going to pull back , that that our that our word matters . and if we do that , we can create a force that will take out isis both in iraq and in syria , which will take a lot longer time now . . . 
bush you mentioned me . he mentioned me . one other thing that i think we ought to do , along with repealing obamacare , we need to shift all of this power of healthcare , which is the most egregious form of federal power that is suppressing wages and incomes , and allow governors to have the medicaid plans so that they can create 21st century medicaid insurance for people that are stuck in poverty . there's so much that can be done , but i don't trust washington to do it . i trust the state capitals to be the place to be the source of innovation and reform in this country . 
fiorina we actually . . . 
trump i did not say that . 
christie well , first off , what we don't do is do what hillary clinton and john kerry and barack obama want us to do , which is their solution for everything , put more taxes on it , give more money to washington , d . c . , and then they will fix it . well , there is no evidence that they can fix anything in washington , d . c . 
trump first of all , i don't believe anything telemundo says . 
kasich let me tell you this , mr . baker , in terms of the cyber attacks , we have the capability to not only have a defensive posture , but it also to make it clear to people that if you attack us with cyber attacks , we will destroy the mechanisms that you are using to attack us . i want to give you a little trip around the world . i served on the defense committee for 18 years . in the ukraine , arm the people there so they can fight for themselves . in the eastern part of europe , make sure that finland and the baltics know that if the russians move , we move . in syria , yes , a no fly zone in the north on the turkish border , a no fly zone on the south on the jordanian border . anybody flies in the first time , maybe they can fly out . they fly in there a second time , they will not fly out . and it also becomes a sanctuary for the people to be . and it also sends many messages in the middle east that we're still involved . saudi arabia , cut off the funding for the radical clerics , the ones that preach against us . but they're fundamentally our friends . jordan , we want the king to reign for 1 , 000 years . egypt , they have been our ally and a moderating force in the middle east throughout their history . in the groups in the countries of the gulf states of bahrain , the cleveland clinic is opening an operation . clearly we see the same with them . and in israel , we have no better ally in the world , and no more criticizing them in public , we should support them . and finally china , china doesn't own the south china sea , and i give the president some credit for being able to move a naval force in there to let the chinese know that we're not going to put up with it any more . and in the trade agreement , the tpp , it's critical to us , not only for economic reasons and for jobs , because there are so many people who are connected to getting jobs because of trade , but it allows us to create not only economy alliances , but also potentially strategic alliances against the chinese . they are not our enemy , but they are certainly not our friend . and finally , i will say to everyone in this room , we have been talking about taxes and economics . when the fall comes , and we run against hillary , which will be a disaster if she got elected . i have two 16 year old girls , and i want this country to be strong . we make promises we can't keep under the bright light of the fall , we will have trouble . we must make sure that economic programs and our military programs are solid . i served in washington as the chairman of the budget committee , and we got the budget balanced . and in ohio , as the ceo , and guess what , we have got to have a ceo mentality and a way to beat hillary clinton and the democracies in the fall . and our ideas have to add up . they have to be solid . and people have to know we have the confidence to lead america . and as president , i will lead this country , as i have before in washington and in ohio , and will return both on domestic and international affairs . and i appreciate the opportunity to speak this time , gerry . 
kasich . . . if we think if we think they're getting close to a to developing a nuclear weapon and we get that information , you better believe that i would do everything in my power as the commander in chief to stop them having a nuclear weapon . 
bush peyton manning is supporting me . and i'm for denver . laughter 
paul understand what they're saying . if they're going to say we are going to enforce the federal law against what the state law is , they aren't really believing in the tenth amendment . governor christie would go into colorado , and if you're breaking any federal law on marijuana , even though the state law allows it , he would put you in jail . if a young mother is trying to give her child cannabis oil for medical marijuana for seizure treatment , he would put her in jail , if it violates federal law . i would let colorado do what the tenth amendment says . this power we were never intended to have crime dealing at the federal level . crime was supposed to be left to the states . colorado has made their decision . and i don't want the federal government interfering and putting moms in jail , who are trying to get medicine for their kid . . . 
trump and i will tell you this . first of all , i got a call from my sister and brother tonight , and they said we had no idea dad gave you 200 million . believe me , i started off with 1 million . i built a company that's worth more than 10 billion . and i say it not in a bragging way , but that's the kind of thinking we need . very low debt , tremendous cash flow . my financials are all they're all in there with the federal elections . you've seen them . everybody has seen them . i say it only because that's the kind of thinking this country needs with 19 trillion in debit . believe me . 
christie not only would i be prepared to do it , i would do it . a no fly zone means a no fly zone , wolf . that's what it means . see , maybe maybe because i'm from new jersey , i just have this kind of plain language hangup . but i would make very clear i would not talk to vladimir putin . in fact , i would talk to vladimir putin a lot . but i'd say to him , listen , mr . president , there's a no fly zone in syria ; you fly in , it applies to you . and yes , we would shoot down the planes of russian pilots if in fact they were stupid enough to think that this president was the same feckless weakling that the president we have in the oval office is right now . 
bush i don't think you're not stating my views right . 
cruz wolf , wolf , wolf . does everyone get to address obamacare but me ? 
paul . . . in his remarks . may i make a response ? 
kasich well , i mean right here . to talk about we're just gonna have a 10 percent tithe and that's how we're gonna fund the government ? and we're going to just fix everything with waste , fraud , and abuse ? or that we're just going to be great ? or we're going to ship 10 million americans or 10 million people out of this country , leaving their children here in this country and dividing families ? folks , we've got to wake up . we cannot elect somebody that doesn't know how to do the job . you have got to pick somebody who has experience , somebody that has the know how , the discipline . and i spent my entire lifetime balancing federal budgets , growing jobs , the same in ohio . and i will go back to washington with my plan . 
rubio . . . in the world for people . . . 
kasich thank you . 
christie yes , i do . and i'll tell you why because i'm the only person on this stage who's actually filed applications under the patriot act , who has gone before the federal the foreign intelligence service court , who has prosecuted and investigated and jailed terrorists in this country after september 11th . i was appointed u . s . attorney by president bush on september 10th , 2001 , and the world changed enormously the next day , and that happened in my state . this is not theoretical to me . i went to the funerals . we lost friends of ours in the trade center that day . my own wife was two blocks from the trade center that day , at her office , having gone through it that morning . when you actually have to be responsible for doing this , you can do it , and we did it , for seven years in my office , respecting civil liberties and protecting the homeland . and i will make no apologies , ever , for protecting the lives and the safety of the american people . we have to give more tools to our folks to be able to do that , not fewer , and then trust those people and oversee them to do it the right way . as president , that is exactly what i'll do . 
cruz . . . wants to face donald trump in the general election . 
trump why did they take the poll ? why did they . . . crosstalk 
paul ooh , that's a tough one . you know , i'm big on that we were and i love what carly said about women's suffrage . i think susan b . anthony might be a good choice . 
trump . . . you know , i watched him meltdown two weeks ago with chris christie . i got to tell you , the biggest problem he's got is he really doesn't know about the lines . the biggest thing we've got , and the reason we've got no competition , is because we have lines around the state , and you have essentially . . . . 
trump wrong . . . 
trump thank you . 
cruz watt you do is enforcement the law . . . 
trump when you say crazy zealot , are you talking about you ? crazy zealot give me a break . 
rubio but he doesn't answer the employment question . 
cruz yeah , you gave me 5 , 000 . 
bush i do . i think the lesson's learned are that we have to have to have a strategy to get and a strategy to get out . which means , that you create a stable situation . this president and this is what the focus ought to be , it's not the differences between us , it's barack obama does not believe america's leadership in the world is a force for good . he does not believe that our strength is a place where security can take place . he leads from behind . he creates an environment that now we're creating the most unstable situation we've had since the world war ii era . the focus ought to be on the single fact that hillary clinton wants to double down on a failed foreign policy and we need to be united to defeat that because we're going to be in a place that is far less secure than it is today . don't you all agree ? 
trump i think you're crosstalk 
christie . . . and while still putting our country at risk . crosstalk 
rubio actually , to be clear . . . crosstalk . . . he supported charlie crist . 
bush i am sick and tired of him going after my family . my dad is the greatest man alive in my mind . and while donald trump was building a reality tv show , my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe . and i'm proud of what he did . and he has had the gall to go after my brother . 
rubio every election is important . i believe this is the most important election in a generation . because what's at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins . what's at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people . for over two centuries , america has been an exceptional nation . and now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way . if we make the right choice in this election , our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous americans that have ever lived . and the 21st century is going to be a new american century . 
cruz i would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use . and indeed , i joined with senator mccain in legislation that would prohibit line officers from employing it because i think bad things happen when enhanced interrogation is employed at lower levels . but when it comes to keeping this country safe , the commander in chief has inherent constitutional authority to keep this country safe . and so , if it were necessary to , say , prevent a city from facing an imminent terrorist attack , you can rest assured that as commander in chief , i would use whatever enhanced interrogation methods we could to keep this country safe . 
trump i'm a negotiator . i've done very well over the years through negotiation . it's very important that we do that . in all fairness , marco is not a negotiator . i watched him melt down and i'll tell you , it was one of the saddest things i've ever seen . he's not going down excuse me . . . 
trump i'm being nice . 
trump i would do so much better than that . 
kasich neil , that's the difference of being an executive . and let me just explain when a bank is ready to go under and depositors are getting ready to lose their life savings , you just don't say we believe in philosophical concerns . you know what an executive has to decide ? when there's a water crisis , how do we get water to the city ? when there's a school shooting , how do you get there and help heal a community ? when there are financial crisis , or a crisis with ebola , you got to go there and try to fix it . philosophy doesn't work when you run something . and i gotta tell you , on the job training for president of the united states doesn't work . we've done it for 8 years , and almost 8 years now . it does not work . we need an executive who's been tried , has been tested , and judge the decisions that that executive makes . i don't like what the fed is doing , but i'll tell you what worries me more than anything else turning the fed over to the congress of the united states . . . 
walker . . . on any of these issues . 
trump correct . first of all , i want to build a wall , a wall that works . so important , and it's a big part of it . second of all , we have a lot of really bad dudes in this country from outside , and i think chris knows that , maybe as well as anybody . they go , if i get elected , first day they're gone . gangs all over the place . chicago , baltimore , no matter where you look . we have a country based on laws . i will make sure that those laws are adhered to . these are illegal immigrants . i don't think you'd even be asking this question if i didn't run because when i ran , and i brought this up , my opening remarks at trump tower , i took heat like nobody has taken heat in a long time . and , then they found out with the killing of katie , from san francisco , and so many other crimes , they found out that i was right . and , most people , many people , apologized to me . i don't think you'd even be talking about illegal immigration if it weren't for me . so , we have a country of laws , they're going to go out , and they'll come back if they deserve to come back . if they've had a bad record , if they've been arrested , if they've been in jail , they're never coming back . we're going to have a country again . right now , we don't have a country , we don't have a border , and we're going to do something about it , and it can be done with proper management , and it can be done with heart . 
cruz count to 10 . the stakes are too high and if you are one of the 65 to 70 percent of republicans who recognize that nominating donald would be a disaster , then i ask you to come join us . if you're supporting other candidates , come join us . we welcome you to our team because we've demonstrated not once , not twice , not three times , but five separate times we have beat donald . and if you don't want him to be the nominee , then i ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the constitution , believe in freedom , and want to turn this country around . 
carson if somebody put me on their homepage , they did it without my permission . 
trump well , i'm very glad that ted mentioned arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is sheriff joe arpaio , and two days ago he totally endorsed me , so , thank you . 
rubio well , the legislation passed , but it has no support . in essence , it couldn't pass in the house , it will never pass in the united states until we secure the border , and it is not the way we're going to do when i'm president . when i'm president , we are going to enforce the law first , prove to people that illegal immigration is under control . and then we'll see what the american people are willing to support when it comes to people that are not criminals , who have been in the this country for a long time and who otherwise would like to stay . 
bush or you could ask me two questions , so i could get two minutes instead of one . 
rubio . . . we already mentioned that inaudible plan , i know what that is , but what else is part of your plan . . . 
fiorina . . . this is why this is why we must combine , actually , zero based budgeting with tax reform because unless we can examine , and cut , and move , every single dollar of discretionary spending in the federal government , we cannot reform taxes and reduce spending at the same time . ask yourself this question , how is it possible that the federal government gets more money each and every year , which the federal government has been doing , receiving more money every year for 50 years under republicans and democrats alike , and yet , never has enough money to do the important things ? the answer ? all the money's always spoken for . all the money's spoken for . so , we have to go to zero based budgeting , which is a simple idea by the way , there's been a bill for zeros based ph budgeting . . . bell ringing . . . it exists , it can be voted on . every dollar must be examined . any dollar can be cut . any dollar can be cut , any dollar can be moved . we have to go to a three page tax code . you lower every rate , you close every loophole , why ? because the government uses the tax code to decide winners , and losers . you have to strip the corruption out of the tax code to pay for it . you have to know where every single dollar is being spent . . . 
kasich well , first of all , we hear about taking on washington . i took on washington and i won . i actually got the budget balanced when i was a member of the congress , the chairman of the budget committee . we paid down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt . we also balanced the budget four years in a row . and we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then . i also had a plan in 1999 to save social security and take the 5 trillion projected surplus and not only have social security for our young people , but also to give them private accounts . now there are more 18 year olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a ufo than a social security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous . i have a plan to fix it that doesn't even require raising the retirement age . if you've had wealth throughout your lifetime , when the time comes to be on social security , you'll still get it . it will just simply be less . and for those people who depend on that social security , they'll get their full benefit . that's the way it will work . and we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age . and how do i know that ? i've done all this before . this is not a theory . do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget ? yes . it doesn't mean you have to cut them . it means you need to innovate them , the way we do things in the 21st century . so not only did we have a balanced budget in washington , but when i went to ohio , we were 8 billion in the hole and now we're 2 billion in the black . our credit is strong . we're up 400 , 000 jobs . and i want to go back with the same formula to beat the washington insiders again . and i will get it done , and this country will be much stronger economically as a result . 
trump well , there is a divide , but i have to say that the police are absolutely mistreated and misunderstood , and if there is an incident , whether it's an incident done purposely which is a horror , and you should really take very strong action or if it is a mistake , it's on your news casts all night , all week , all month , and it never ends . the police in this country have done an unbelievable job of keeping law and order , and they're afraid for their jobs , they're afraid of the mistreatment they get , and i'm telling you that not only , me speaking , minorities all over the country , they respect the police of this country and we have to give them more respect . they can't act . they can't act . they're afraid for losing their pension , their job . they don't know what to do . and i deal with them all the time . we have to give great respect , far greater than we are right now , to our really fantastic police . 
paul the first thing i would do as president is repeal the regulations that are hampering our energy that the president has put in place . including the clean power act . while i do think that man may have a role in our climate , i think nature also has a role . the planet's 4 . 5 billion years old , we've been through geologic age after geologic age . we've had times when the temperatures been warmer , we've had times when the temperatures been colder . we've had times when the carbon in the atmosphere's been higher . so , i think before we we need to look before we leap . president's often fond of saying he wants a balance solution , but , really we do need to balance both keeping the environment clean , and we will have some rules for that . we got to balance that with the economy . he's devastated my state . i say the president's not only destroying kentucky , he's destroying the democrat party down there because nobody wants to associate with him . so , what we really need is somebody that understands that we do need energy of all forms , and that means we will have solar , and wind , and hydro , but we will still have coal , and we still will have natural gas . and , we've got to have an all of the above policy . but , it would be a mistake to shut down all of our industries in the coal fields , and shut down the coal power plants . if we did so we're going to have a day where we wake up and some of our big cities are either very cold , or very hot . so , i think it's a big danger , and we shouldn't do it . and , what we should do is say we want all of the above . . . bell ringing . . . we want to free up the energy sector , and let people produce , let them drill , let them explore . 
fiorina . . . the more the government gets engaged in the economy , the slower the economy becomes . the more the government gets engaged in the economy , it is demonstrably true . . . 
kasich i wanted i wanted to say , look , this there can be a win win here . i have formed a collaborative between police and community leaders because people have to respect law enforcement . a family doesn't want dad or mom going home in a box . and for our community leaders , many of them think the system not only works not only doesn't work for them , but it works against them . and i created a big collaborative in ohio made up of law enforcement , community leaders , the head of my public safety and a former democrat , liberal senate senator nina turner , run it . they got together , they made recommendations on recruiting , on hiring , on the use of deadly force and what we're about to do is to bring community and police together so we can have a win win . we need more win wins in america and we don't have to pick one over another divide . we love the police , but we've got to be responsible to the people in the community . we have to do all of that . 
rubio no . he talked about barack obama . 
kasich this campaign , i hope you will give to me . 
cruz don , i need to go on . . . 
walker . . . the key issue here is talking about leadership . now , there's a lot of greater people up here , and you've heard a lot of great ideas out there . but i would ask the american people , look at who's been tested . when there were 100 , 000 protesters in my capital , i didn't back down , when they issued death threats against me and threats against my family , i didn't back down , when they tried to recall me , i didn't back down , and when they made me the one of their number one targets last year , i didn't back down . give me the chance to be your president . 
cruz adults learn not to interrupt people . 
trump i wouldn't have drawn the line , but once he drew it , he had no choice but to go across . they do bear some responsibility , but i think he probably didn't do it , not for that reason . somehow , he just doesn't have courage . there is something missing from our president . had he crossed the line and really gone in with force , done something to assad if he had gone in with tremendous force , you wouldn't have millions of people displaced all over the world . 
kasich thank you . 
cruz the answer is simple . your prosecute criminals . you target the bad guys . you know , a minute ago , neil asked what has president obama do done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns ? well , he appointed eric holder as attorney general . eric holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the american people against guns . he appointed sonia sotomayor to the supreme court , someone who has been a radical against the second amendment right to keep and bear arms . he launched fast and furious , illegally selling guns to mexican drug lords that were then used to shoot law enforcement officials . and i'll tell you what hillary clinton has said hillary clinton says she agrees with the dissenters the supreme court dissenters in the heller case . there were four dissenters , and they said that they believe the second amendment protects no individual right to keep and bear arms whatsoever , which means , if their view prevailed and the next president's going to get one , two , three , maybe four supreme court justices , the court will rule that not a single person in this room has any right under the second amendment and the government could confiscate your guns . and i'll note that california senator democratic senator dianne feinstein said , if she could say to mr . america and mrs . america , give me your guns , i'm rounding them up , she would . and let me make a final point on this . listen , in any republican primary , everyone is going to say they support the second amendment . unless you are clinically insane . . . laughter . . . that's what you say in a primary . but the voters are savvier than that . they recognize that people's actions don't always match their words . i've got a proven record fighting to defend the second amendment . there's a reason gun owners of america has endorsed me in this race . there's a reason the nra gave me their carter knight freedom fund award . . . bell rings . . . and there's a reason , when barack obama and chuck schumer came after our right to keep and bear arms , that i led the opposition , along with millions of americans we defeated that gun control legislation . and i would note the other individuals on this stage were nowhere to be found in that fight . 
trump i didn't want it was my obligation as a businessman to my family , to my company , to my employees , to get along with all politicians . i get along with all of them , and i did a damn good job in doing it . go ahead . 
bush they are relevant if we want to destroy isis . if we want to destroy radical islamic terrors , we can't disassociate ourselves from peace loving muslims . if we expect to do this on our own , we will fail but if we do it in unison with people who are also are at risk and threatened by islamic radical terrorism , we'll be far more successful . look , the fbi has the tools necessary un american activities in our country . it goes on , we shouldn't even be talking about it , to be honest with you out in the public . of course they have those capabilities and we should make sure that we give the fbi , the nsa , our intelligence communities , all the resources they need to keep us safe . but the main thing we should be focused on is the strategy to destroy isis . and i laid out a plan that the reagan library before the tragedy of paris , and before san bernardino to do just that . it requires leadership , it's not filing an amendment and call it a success . it is developing a strategy , leading the world , funding it to make sure that we have a military that's second to none , and doing the job and making sure that we destroy isis there . that's how you keep america safe . 
rubio well , first of all , if a company gets caught doing that , they should never be able to use the program again . if you get caught abusing this program , you should never be able to use it again . the second thing i said is we need to add reforms , not just increase the numbers , but add reforms . for example , before you hire anyone from abroad , you should have to advertise that job for 180 days . you also have to prove that you're going to pay these people more than you would pay someone else , so that you're not undercutting it by bringing in cheap labor . but here's the best solution of all . we need to get back to training people in this country to do the jobs of the 21st century . why , for the life of me , i do not understand why did we stop doing vocational education in america , people that can work with their hands ; people you can train to do this work while they're still in high school so they can graduate ready to go work . but the best way to close this gap is to modernize higher education so americans have the skills for those jobs . but in the interim , in the absence of that , what's happening is some of these tech companies are taking those those centers ph to canada because they can get people to go over there instead of here . but the ideal scenario is to train americans to do the work so we don't have to rely on people from abroad . 
cruz i have never supported a legalization . . . 
cruz so , i've released five years of tax returns already . we will have two more years available tomorrow . and i would note that this question really goes you know , donald says he's being audited . well , i would think that would underscore the need to release those returns . if he has said something that was false and that an audit is going to find was fraudulent , the voters need to know . and listen , people across this country , we recognize our country is in crisis . the most important question is how do we win the general election in november , 2016 . and roughly 65 percent of republicans think donald is not the right candidate to go against hillary clinton . now , part of the reason in the last 10 polls . . . 
cruz he's told us to look to the cnn poll . well , that's a very good poll to look to , because that cnn poll showed that head to head donald trump loses to hillary clinton by 8 points . he doesn't just lose close ; he loses by 8 points . that same poll he told you to look at shows me beating hillary clinton . we cannot mess this up . and , by the way , the last four polls in a row , when you nominate a candidate who literally has been on every side of every issue , and in the course of this debate may be on two other sides before we're done , that's not how you win . and the stakes are too high . crosstalk 
bush this is a this is an important subject . i agree with everything that's been said here about repealing unconstitutional rules and rules that are creating real burdens for investing that creating jobs . but we also ought to get back to being a tenth amendment country , as well , a country that respects the states to be able to make more decisions . and in the bush administration , we would shift transportation dollars back to the states . i trust kasich and christie to build the roads and the infrastructure of their states than washington , d . c . epa delegated authority , back to the states . education dollars , back to the states . i would like to see reform take place all across the country , where there's more vouchers , more freedom . if we did that , we would shrink government's power in washington , d . c . and we would have a much more effective government , where people would begin to trust our government again , because now , no one believes it works . 
trump true . 
trump the the the other hotels during the season , they do the same thing . they take in a lot of people , because you can't get them . they take in a lot of people . long term employees , we don't do that , but short term employees , we have no choice but to do it , and other hotels in that very , very hot area . it is a very hot area . 
fiorina well , gee , after the last debate , i was told that i didn't smile enough . laughter 
bush but i think we have to be cognizant of the fact there's a lot of people that are concerned about having a pro life position without any exceptions . 
cruz megyn , we need a commander in chief that speaks the truth . we will not defeat radical islamic terrorism so long as we have a president unwilling to utter the words , radical islamic terrorism . when i asked general dempsey , the chairman of the joint chiefs , what would be required militarily to destroy isis , he said there is no military solution . we need to change the conditions on the ground so that young men are not in poverty and susceptible to radicalization . that , with all due respect , is nonsense . it's the same answer the state department gave that we need to give them jobs . what we need is a commander in chief who makes clear , if you join isis , if you wage jihad on america , then you are signing your death warrant . 
huckabee i don't know . 
trump marco talks about consequences . well , we've had a lot of consequences , including airplanes flying into the world trade center , the pentagon and could have been the white house . there have been a lot of problems . now you can say what you want , and you can be politically correct if you want . i don't want to be so politically correct . i like to solve problems . we have a serious , serious problem of hate . there is tremendous hate . there is tremendous hate . where large portions of a group of people , islam , large portions want to use very , very harsh means . let me go a step further . women are treated horribly . you know that . you do know that . women are treated horribly , and other things are happening that are very , very bad . bell rings now i will say this , there is tremendous hatred . the question was asked , what do you think ? i said , there is hatred . now it would be very easy for me to say something differently . and everybody would say , oh , isn't that wonderful . 
trump all right . first of all , let me just explain . i was the first one to file a financial disclosure form almost 100 pages . you don't learn anything about somebody's wealth with a tax return . you learn it from statements . i filed which shows that i'm worth over 10 billion . i built a great company with very little debt . people were shocked , the people in the back , the reporters , they were shocked when they went down . and i filed it on time . i didn't ask for five 45 day extensions , which i would have been entitled to . so as far as that's concerned , i filed it . and that's where you find out what kind of a company . you don't learn anything from a tax return . i will say this . mitt romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed . and harry reid baited him so beautifully . and mitt romney didn't file his return until a september 21st of 2012 , about a month and a half before the election . and it cost him big league . as far as my return , i want to file it , except for many years , i've been audited every year . twelve years , or something like that . every year they audit me , audit me , audit me . nobody gets audited i have friends that are very wealthy people . they never get audited . i get audited every year . i will absolutely give my return , but i'm being audited now for two or three years , so i can't do it until the audit is finished , obviously . and i think people would understand that . 
trump . . . was you're going to you're going to destabilize . . . 
paul a second opinion ? laughter one of the greatest one of the greatest medical discoveries of all times was were the vaccines , particularly for smallpox . and if you want to read a story , it's called the speckled monster , it's an amazing story , it was all done voluntary . but people came in by the droves . george washington wouldn't let his wife visit until she got vaccinated . so i'm all for vaccines . but i'm also for freedom . i'm also a little concerned about how they're bunched up . my kids had all of their vaccines , and even if the science doesn't say bunching them up is a problem , i ought to have the right to spread out my vaccines out a little bit at the very least . 
cruz . . . the years you're not being audited ? will you release those years ? 
kasich and i'm going to stay positive about what i want to do from the . . . 
bush so , here's the deal . my wife is a mexican american . she's an american by choice . she loves this country as much as anybody in this room , and she wants a secure border . but she wants to embrace the traditional american values that make us special and make us unique . we're at a crossroads right now . are we going to take the reagan approach , the hopeful optimistic approach , the approach that says that , you come to our country legally , you pursue your dreams with a vengeance , you create opportunities for all of us ? or the donald trump approach ? the approach that says that everything is bad , that everything is coming to an end . i . . . 
kasich well , look , first of all , i think the mayor now is controlling the schools . this is not much different than what happened in cleveland , ohio , where the african american democrat mayor , the union , and business leaders came to see me and said , would you help us to pass legislation to really create a ceo environment so that we can take control of the schools ? we even invested in a buyout plan , where we bought out the teachers who had been there a long time , because there were so many young teachers who had been laid off who were so enthusiastic to get back in the schools . it worked beautifully . cleveland's coming back . the cleveland schools are coming back because of a major overhaul . it's the same thing that has to happen in all of our urban schools . and , frankly , look , if i were president , i'd take 104 federal programs , bundle them into four buckets , and send it to the states , because fixing schools rests at the state and the local level , and particularly at the school board level . now , i also believe i also believe that you need to introduce vocational education in those schools . you need mentoring in those schools . and you need to have a situation where people can have an alternative forum to get a degree . and you need school choice , both vouchers and charter schools . all of those things can come together to help , megyn . but here's the bottom line . and i'll go quickly . we as adults have to fight in our neighborhoods , in our communities , for our children's education . put the politics aside , and everyone in this room can play a role in lifting their schools and lifting the students who are in those schools , because too much politics gets in the middle of it , and where we focus as adults , and put children first , we see tremendous results . and the people of this town are going to rise . and they need to be involved . thank you . 
kasich well , first of all , look . as the new york times said , he's certainly not a moderate , but he can bring people together to solve problems . the fact of the matter is i've cut taxes more than anybody in the country this year . i have balanced budgets , the federal budget , the state of ohio budget , we're running a 2 billion dollar surplus , we're up 400 , 000 jobs , and in washington we were able to have significant job growth whenever we balanced the budget of which i was the architect . but , here's the beauty of it , it's not just balancing a budget , it's about jobs . you know , when i was kid growing up in a neighborhood where dad went home at night and said , i lost my job today , it just killed the family . it just was a devastating effect . we have to have economic growth , but once we have economic growth i believe we have to reach out to people who live in the shadows . i believe we need to help the mentally ill , the drug addicted , the working poor . we need to help the developmentally disabled to rise , and we need to help our friends in the minority community develop entrepreneurship . in other words , in american , conservatism should mean not only that some rise with conservative principles , but everybody has a chance to rise regardless of who they are so they can live their god given purpose . that's what conservatism should be . 
fiorina that's not for me to answer ; it is for the voters of this country to answer , and i have a lot of faith in the common sense and good judgment of the voters of the united states of america . 
fiorina jake , may i just say . . . 
huckabee . . . chris . . . 
huckabee . . . you don't want me operating on you , i assure you . laughter 
fiorina . . . and be held accountable . 
bush i have a proven record . i have a proven record . 
trump it's called pending litigation . 
rubio it's great to be here , back at home in miami . it's hard to believe that just two decades ago , my father was just a bartender working in the city . and now his son stands on this stage , here , as a candidate for the highest office in the land . my parents never wanted me to go into politics or in particular or anything else . they just wanted me to have the opportunity to live out all the dreams they once had for themselves . and that was possible because america is a special country . but that was not an accident . america is great because each generation before us did what needed to be done . they solved their problems , they confronted their challenges . they embraced their opportunities . and for over two centuries , each generation has left the next better off . and now the moment has arrived for our generation to do our part . and i'm telling you tonight , if you vote for me , here in florida and everywhere across this country on tuesday , when i'm elected president , this generation will do it's part . we will do whatever it takes to ensure that our children inherit from us , what we inherited from our parents , the single greatest nation in the history of all of mankind . 
rubio and he's also sowing instability in the middle east . you have iran who's going to get 100 billion of sanctions relief . you have radical jihadists spreading all over the world . this is a time for seriousness on these issues . you have yet to answer a single serious question about any of this . will you give us a detailed answer about foreign policy any time you're asked on it ? 
rubio well , here's the response . i think anyone who believes that barack obama isn't doing what he's doing on purpose doesn't understand what we're dealing with here , ok ? this is a president this is a president who is trying to change this country . when he talked about change , he wasn't talking about dealing with our problems . obamacare was not an accident . the undermining of the second amendment is not an accident . the gutting of our military is not an accident . the undermining of america on the global stage is not an accident . barack obama is , indeed , trying to redefine this country . we better understand what we're dealing with here , because that's what hillary clinton and bernie sanders want to double down on if they are elected . 
cruz so i'd like to ask donald , why did you write checks to hillary clinton to be president in 2008 ? it wasn't for business . and how can you stand on a debate stage now with her and say you don't think she should be president ? 
trump new people are coming into the republican party . we are building a new republican party , a lot of new people are coming in . 
cruz that is simply . . . crosstalk 
bush but the simple fact is 
trump this is a lot of fun up here tonight , i have to tell you . thank thank you for the book . i really appreciate it . 
cruz and , maria , i will note , she's got a lot of experience , but her policies have proven disastrous . if you look at foreign policy , every region in the world has gotten worse . under her leadership , we abandon the nation of israel . under her leadership , radical islamic terrorism has been on to the rise . under her leadership , and obama's leadership , iran is getting 100 billion dollars , and on the verge of getting a nuclear weapon . everything she's put her hand to , or has touched and when we talk about the cronyism of washington , hillary clinton embodies the cronyism . . . bell ringing . . . of washington . and , i'll give you an example of that , which is the congressional exemption from obamacare , which is fundamentally wrong , and i'll tell you this , if i'm elected president , i will veto any statute that exempts members of congress . the law should apply evenly to every american . 
fiorina the issue is who is going to get it done . crosstalk 
paul well , it's a great question , neil , and thanks for including me in the tax debate . i think what's important about the tax debate is , is that we have to ask the question , where is money best spent , in the private sector or in the government sector ? i want a government really , really small , so small you can barely see it . so i want lower taxes and much more money in the private sector . cheering and applause my tax plan , however , is the only tax plan among any of the candidates on the stage that is part of a balanced budget plan . i put forward three plans that actually balance the budget over a five year period . each of these plans have details on exactly where we would cut . the question came up earlier , where would you cut ? nobody likes to say where they would cut . i've put pencil to paper and done three budgets that actually balance . i'm also in favor of a plan called the penny plan where we'd just cut 1 percent across the board and the budget actually balances in less than five years . so i think what is extraordinary about my tax plan is it is in the context of balancing the budget . what is also extraordinary about my tax plan is it gets rid of the payroll tax . democrats demagogue this issue to death , and when they do they say , oh , a millionaire would get a bigger tax cut than someone making 10 , 000 . that's proportionality , as ben is trying to explain to folks . but the thing is , is if we get rid of the payroll tax , everybody is going to get a tax cut . and this is something that i think the public at large will support and could win an election . 
trump if people my plan is very simple . i will not we're going to have private we are going to have health care , but i will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if i'm president . you may let it and you may be fine with it . . . 
cruz . . . so you don't actually want to hear the answer , john ? 
carson something about the draft . very quickly . 
trump some ? 
trump well , i'll tell you over the years , i've made many speeches . people have asked me , big companies have asked me to make speeches , and friends of mine that run big companies on success . and occasion , in order to sort of really highlight something , i'll use a profanity . one of the profanities that i got credited with using , that i didn't use , was a very bad word , two weeks ago , that i never used . i said , you . and everybody said oh , he didn't say anything wrong . but you bleeped it , so everyone thinks i said the i didn't say anything . i never said the word . it is very unfair , that criticism . now , i will say this , with all of that being said , i have said i will not do it at all , because if i say a word that's a little bit off color , a little bit , it ends up being a headline . i will not do it again . i was a very good student at a great school not using by the way not using profanity is very easy . 
trump probably , i don't know you people write the stuff . i don't know where you . . . laughter and if i could say just one thing . i am the only person in either campaign that's self funding . i'm putting up 100 percent of my own money . and right now , i will be putting up a tremendous so far , i've put up less than anybody and i have the best results . wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that ? but i will be putting i will be putting up , you know , tremendous amounts of money . superpacs are a disaster . they're a scam . they cause dishonesty . and you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people . and i'm not blaming these folks well , i guess i could . laughter very good people are making very bad decisions right now . and if anything comes out of this whole thing with some of these nasty and ridiculous questions , i will tell you , you better get rid of the superpacs because they causing a big problem with this country , not only in dishonesty and what's going on , but also in a lot of bad decisions that have been made for the benefit of lobbyists and special interests . 
paul i think this gets to the point of wisdom on when to intervene and when we shouldn't . had we bombed assad at the time , like president obama wanted , and like hillary clinton wanted and many republicans wanted , i think isis would be in damascus today . i think isis would be in charge of syria had we bombed assad . sometimes both sides of the civil war are evil , and sometimes intervention sometimes makes us less safe . this is real the debate we have to have in the middle east . every time we have toppled a secular dictator , we have gotten chaos , the rise of radical islam , and we're more at risk . so , i think we need to think before we act , and know most interventions , if not a lot of them in the middle east , have actually backfired on us . 
cruz we need to do whatever is necessary to utterly defeat isis . and that's needs to be driven not by politicians but by military expertise and judgment . right now we're not using a fraction of the tools that we have . we're not using our overwhelming air power . we're not arming the kurds . those need to be the first steps . and then we need to put whatever ground power is needed to carry it out . but , you know , a question that actually jake asked , and i'm glad to come back to it now , is rules of engagement . we have right now our troops engaged in combat but president obama has rules of engagement that are so strict that their arms are tied behind their back . they're not able to fight . they're not able to defend themselves . they're not able to kill the enemy . and i have got to tell you , hugh , i think that is wrong . it is immoral . and i give my word to every soldier , sailor , and airman , and marine , and every wife and husband , every son and daughter , every mother and father , that will end in january 2017 . 
trump florida went down the tubes right after he got out of office . 
trump . . . we have a 98 percent approval rating from the people who took the course . we have an a from the better business bureau . and , people like it . now , he's saying they didn't learn . we have many , many people that will be witnesses . again , i don't settle cases . i don't do it because that's why i don't get sued very often , because i don't settle , unlike a lot of other people . we have a situation where we will win in court . . . bell ringing . . . but , many of the people that are witnesses did tremendously well , and made a lot of money . . . 
trump . . . i'm not fine with it . we are going to take those people . . . 
trump we really have no choice . we have to knock out isis . we have to knock the hell out of them . we have to get rid of it . and then come back and rebuild our country , which is falling apart . we have no choice . 
rubio you've expressed admiration for him . 
trump nothing . 
bush don't vote for me if you want to keep the gridlock in washington , d . c . 
christie first of , jake , i don't yield to anybody on how to enforce the law . i'm the only person on this stage who spent seven years as a united states attorney after september 11th , and i know how to do this . the fact is though that for 15 , 000 people a day to be deported every day for two years is an undertaking that almost none of us could accomplish given the current levels of funding , and the current number of law enforcement officers . here's what we need to do , and i think this is where donald is absolutely right . what we need to do is to secure our border , and we need to do it with more than just a wall . we need to use electronics , we need to use drones , we need to use fbi , dea , and atf , and yes , we need to take the fingerprint of every person who comes into this country on a visa , and when they overstay their visa , we need to tap them on the shoulder , and say , you have overstayed your welcome , you're taking advantage of the american people . it's time for you to go . if we had that kind of system in place , we wouldn't have the 11 million people we have now . 
fiorina the alternative is to allow states to manage high risk pools for those who really need help . look , i'm a cancer survivor , ok ? i understand that you cannot have someone who's battled cancer just become known as a pre existing condition . i understand that you cannot allow families to go bankrupt if they truly need help . but , i also understand that obamacare isn't helping anyone . we're throwing more , and more people into medicaid , and fewer , and fewer doctors are taking those payments . the point is obamacare is crushing small businesses , it is not helping the families it was intended to help . so , let us allow states to manage high risk pools . let us try the one thing in health insurance we've never tried , the free market . let us ensure that as patients , and customers . . . 
cruz i'm going to he had no fewer than 11 attacks there . i appreciate your dumping your inaudible research folder on the stage . 
fiorina having met vladimir putin , i wouldn't talk to him at all . we've talked way too much to him . what i would do , immediately , is begin rebuilding the sixth fleet , i would begin rebuilding the missile defense program in poland , i would conduct regular , aggressive military exercises in the baltic states . i'd probably send a few thousand more troops into germany . vladimir putin would get the message . by the way , the reason it is so critically important that every one of us know general suleimani's name is because russia is in syria right now , because the head of the quds force traveled to russia and talked vladimir putin into aligning themselves with iran and syria to prop up bashar al assad . russia is a bad actor , but vladimir putin is someone we should not talk to , because the only way he will stop is to sense strength and resolve on the other side , and we have all of that within our control . we could rebuild the sixth fleet . i will . we haven't . we could rebuild the missile defense program . we haven't . i will . we could also , to senator rubio's point , give the egyptians what they've asked for , which is intelligence . we could give the jordanians what they've asked for . . . 
trump no , i'm sorry . no , excuse me . i was there . 
trump make me president . 
rubio yeah . 
cruz well maria , thank you for passing on that hit piece in the front page of the new york times . you know the nice thing about the mainstream media , they don't hide their views . the new york times a few weeks back had a columnist who wrote a column saying , anybody but cruz . had that actually that same columnist wrote a column comparing me to an evil demonic spirit from the move , it follows that jumps apparently from body to body possessing people . so you know the new york times and i don't have exactly have the warmest of relationships . now in terms of their really stunning hit piece , what they mentioned is when i was running for senate unlike hillary clinton , i don't have masses of money in the bank , hundreds of millions of dollars . when i was running for senate just about every lobbyist , just about all of the establishment opposed me in the senate race in texas and my opponent in that race was worth over 200 million dollars . he put a 25 million dollar check up from his own pocket to fund that campaign and my wife heidi and i , we ended up investing everything we owned . we took a loan against our assets to invest it in that campaign to defend ourselves against those attacks . and the entire new york times attack is that i disclosed that loan on one filing with the united states senate , that was a public filing . but it was not on a second filing with fdic and yes , i made a paperwork error disclosing it on one piece of paper instead of the other . but if that's the best the new york times has got , they better go back to the well . 
rubio when they're done with the yoga , can i answer a question ? 
bush yes . 
huckabee let me just close it out this way . 
carson well , i could take issue with with all of those things , but we don't have time . but i will say , we have a debate here tonight , and we will have an opportunity to explore those areas , and i'm looking very much forward to demonstrating that , in fact , the thing that is probably most important is having a brain , and to be able to figure things out and learn things very rapidly . so , you know , experience comes from a large number of different arenas , and america became a great nation early on not because it was flooded with politicians , but because it was flooded with people who understood the value of personal responsibility , hard work , creativity , innovation , and that's what will get us on the right track now , as well . 
bush gronkowski is still going strong . i have ryan tannehill , marco , as my quarterback , he was 18 for 19 last week . so i'm doing great . but we're not gambling . and i think this has become something that needs to be looked at in terms of regulation . effectively it is day trading without any regulation at all . and when you have insider information , which apparently has been the case , where people use that information and use big data to try to take advantage of it , there has to be some regulation . if they can't regulate themselves , then the nfl needs to look at just , you know , moving away from them a little bit . and there should be some regulation . i have no clue whether the federal government is the proper place , my instinct is to say , hell no , just about everything about the federal government . crosstalk 
trump . . . i can give it to you . i can give it to you tomorrow . . 
fiorina i agree with senator paul . i agree with states' rights . but we are misleading young people when we tell them that marijuana is just like having a beer . it's not . and the marijuana that kids are smoking today is not the same as the marijuana that jeb bush smoked 40 years ago . laughter we do sorry , barbara . we do need we do need criminal justice reform . we have the highest incarceration rates in the world . two thirds of the people in our prisons are there for non violent offenses , mostly drug related . it's clearly not working . but we need to tell young people the truth . drug addiction is an epidemic , and it is taking too many of our young people . i know this sadly from personal experience . 
carson probably in terms of the applying for the job of president , a weakness would be not really seeing myself in that position until hundreds of thousands of people began to tell me that i needed to do it . i do , however , believe in reagan's 11th commandment , and will not be engaging in awful things about my compatriots here . and recognizing that it's so important , this election , because we're talking about america for the people versus america for the government . 
walker well , i turned 13 years old two days before ronald reagan was first elected . a lot of people forget this , but just a few days before that election 1980 , he was behind in the polls . and i think what changed things was people in america realized they didn't want to hear what was bad about america , they wanted to know how it was going to be better . ronald reagan wasn't just a conservative republican , he was an eternal optimist in the american people . and i am too . so here's what i think will make america better . we need to live in a world where our children are free , are free from the threats of radical islamic terrorism . we need to live in an america where we have an economy , where everyone can live their piece of the american dream , no matter what that dream is . and we need to live in an america where we have a federal government that is not too big to fail , but ultimately small enough to succeed , where we send powers back to the states and back to the people . that's what i did in wisconsin . we took on the big government union bosses , the big government special interests , many of whom came in from washington , to spend millions of dollars to try and take me out because we stood up to them , we didn't back down in any of those instances . if you give me the chance as your next president , i won't back down any day , anyway , anyhow . i'll fight and win for you and your families every single day i'm in office . 
bush yeah . 
trump . . . before they had the information it got it is right now an a , once they had the information . . . 
trump first of all , john got lucky with a thing called fracking , ok ? he hit oil . he got lucky with fracking . believe me , that is why ohio is doing well . number and that is important for you to know . number two , this was the man that was a managing general partner at lehman brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it , including ben and myself , because i was there and i watched what happened . and lehman brothers started it all . he was on the board . and he was a managing general partner . and just thirdly , he was so nice . he was such a nice guy . and he said , oh , i'm never going to attack . but then his poll numbers tanked . he has got that is why he is on the end . laughter and he got nasty . and he got nasty . so you know what ? you can have him . crosstalk 
trump but not when it comes to abortion . 
cruz . . . abusing american workers . . . 
trump not much . 
trump well , first of all , like many other very big businessmen , i could name them here , but i'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons , but the biggest , and almost all of them , they've all used the chapter laws , the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit . before this , i was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman . atlantic city has gone bad . i mean , chris will know about that . i'm not blaming chris , by the way , but he will know about that . caesar's excuse me caesar's , the rolls royce , as you know , is in bankruptcy . almost every hotel in atlantic city has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy the biggest . but also the biggest people ph now i've used that to my advantage as a business man , for my family , for myself . i never filed for bankruptcy . but many , many people did . what happened with atlantic city is very , very disgraceful . now hundreds of companies i've opened . i've used it three times , maybe four times . came out great . but i guess i'm supposed to come out great . that is what i could do for the country . we owe 19 trillion , boy am i good at solving debt problems . nobody can solve it like me . but i will tell you this , atlantic city , you're using that , hundreds of companies that i have opened have thrived . i built a net worth of way over 10 billion , and i have done it four times out of hundreds . and i'm glad i did it . i used the laws of the country to my benefit , i'm sorry . 
bush my name was mentioned . my name was mentioned here . the simple fact is that the plane that's being build here is being sold to china . you can if you you flew in with your 767 , didn't you ? right there , right next to the plant . 
rubio and the second amendment when people talk about gun laws , what they need to realize is , criminals don't follow gun laws . they're criminals . by definition , they ignore the law . but the gun rights of americans , if you are talking to a law abiding citizen and a gun owner like myself , if you pass a law , i will follow whatever the law is . a criminal will not do it . they will continue to pursue these guns on the black market , where they then go out and commit crimes and they steal guns from each other . gun laws are not effective . they simply do not provide for safety . but they do , however , ensure that law abiding people don't have access to weapons to protect themselves and guns to protect themselves , but criminals always will be well armed . they don't care about the law ; they don't follow the law . we will protect the second amendment when i'm president of the united states . 
rubio well , megyn , first of all , i'm not sure that that's a correct assessment of my record . i would go on to add that i believe all 
cruz now , major , the business flat tax that is in my tax plan is not a vat . a vat in europe is a sales tax . the business flat tax is not a sales tax , it is a tax of 16 percent opposed fairly and evenly across the board on all business . one of the things that's critical is we're doing that in conjunction with abolishing the corporate income tax , with abolishing the obamacare taxes , with abolishing the payroll taxes , which are the biggest taxes paid by most working americans , and with abolishing the death tax , which is cruel and unfair . and you asked about economic growth the nonpartisan tax foundation estimated a simple flat tax that would produce 4 . 9 million new jobs , it would increase capital investment by 44 percent and would lift everyone's income by double digits . that's how you turn the country around , not just hoping and praying for it , but implementing policies that work . 
cruz well , i wouldn't change the 10 bill , i'd change the 20 . i'd take jackson off and i'd leave alexander hamilton right where he is as one of our founding fathers . and i very much agree with marco that it should be rosa parks . she was a principled pioneer that helped change this country , helped remedy racial injustice , and that would be an honor that would be entirely appropriate . 
rubio that's an interesting question . that's exactly what the republican establishment says too . why don't you wait in line ? wait for what ? this country is running out of time . we can't afford to have another four years like the last eight years . watching this broadcast tonight are millions of people that are living paycheck to paycheck . they're working as hard as they ever have , everything costs more , and they haven't had a raise in decades . you have small businesses in america that are struggling . for the first time in 35 years , we have more businesses closing than starting . we have a world that's out of control and has grown dangerous and a president that is weakening our military and making our foreign policy unstable and unreliable in the eyes of our allies . and our adversaries continue to grow stronger . we have a they say there's no bipartisanship in washington ? we have a 19 trillion bipartisan debt and it continues to grow as we borrow money from countries that do not like us to pay for government we cannot afford . the time to act is now . the time to turn the page is now . if we if we don't act now , we are going to be the first generation in american history that leaves our children worse off than ourselves . 
paul this legislation on indefinite detention . . . 
rubio well , that's the that's the reason why this campaign is so important . because i think this notion i think this is an important point . we have to understand what we're going through here . we are not facing a president that doesn't know what he's doing . he knows what he is doing . that's why he's done the things he's done . that's why we have a president that passed obamacare and the stimulus . all this damage that he's done to america is deliberate . this is a president that's trying to redefine this country . that's why this election is truly a referendum on our identity as a nation , as a people . our future is at stake . this election is not about the past . it is about what kind of country this is going to be in the 21st century , and if we elect someone like barack obama , a hillary clinton , a bernie sanders or anyone like that , our children are going to be the first americans to inherit a diminishes country . that will not happen if i'm elected . 
carson you also have to get rid of all the deductions and all the loopholes . you also have to some strategically cutting in several places . remember , we have 645 federal agencies and sub agencies . anybody who tells me that we need every penny and every one of those is in a fantasy world . so , also , we can stimulate the economy . that's gonna be the real growth engine . stimulating the economy because it's tethered down right now with so many regulations . . . 
fiorina i think what this nation can be and must be is symbolized by lady liberty and lady justice . lady liberty stands tall and strong . she is clear eyed and resolute . she doesn't shield her eyes from the realities of the world , but she faces outward into the world nevertheless , as we always must . and she holds her torch high , because she knows she is a beacon of hope in a very troubled world . and lady justice , lady justice holds a sword by her side , because she is a fighter , a warrior for the values and the principles that have made this nation great . she holds a scale in her other hand . and with that scale she says all of us are equal in the eyes of god . and so all of us must be equal in the eyes of the law and the government , powerful and powerless alike . and she wears a blindfold . and with that blindfold she is saying to us that it must be true , it can be true that in this country , in this century , it doesn't matter who you are , it doesn't matter what you look like , it doesn't matter how you start , it doesn't matter your circumstances , here in this nation , every american's life must be filled with the possibilities that come from their god given gifts . one nation , under god , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . 
cruz inaudible . . . 
trump that's not the way the game is supposed to be played . 
bush . . . is a great negotiator , that she could bring about a better deal on iran ? 
cruz but i will say 
huckabee . . . before i go . this is the only time i've had a chance , let me finish . 
walker but jake , this this is this . . . 
paul i think that if you believe in regime change , you're mistaken . in 2013 , we put 600 tons of weapons us , saudi arabia , and qatar into the war against assad . by pushing assad back , we did create a safe space . we had people coming to our foreign relations committee and saying , oh , we need to arm the allies of al qaida . they are still saying this . it is a crazy notion . this is the biggest debate we should be having tonight is is regime change a good idea ; has it been a good idea . there are still people the majority on the stage , they want to topple assad . and then there will be chaos , and i think isis will then be in charge of syria . 
trump and by the way and by the way . . . 
kasich well , i created a task force well over a year ago and the purpose was to bring law enforcement , community people , clergy and the person that i named as one of the co chair was a lady by the name of nina turner , a former state senator , a liberal democrat . she actually ran against one of my friends and our head of public safety . and they say down as a group trying to make sure that we can begin to heal some of these problems that we see between community and police . and they came back with 23 recommendations . one of them is a statewide use of deadly force . and it is now being put into place everyplace across the state of ohio . secondly , a policy on recruiting and hiring , and then more resources for for training . but let me also tell you , one of the issues has got to be the integration of both community and police . community has to understand that that police officer wants to get home at night , and not not to lose their life . their family is waiting for them . at the same time , law enforcement understands there are people in the community who not only think that the system doesn't work for them , but works against them . see , in ohio , we've had some controversial decisions . but the leaders have come forward to realize that protest is fine , but violence is wrong . and it has been a remarkable situation in our state . and as president of the united states , it's all about communication , folks . it's all about getting people to listen to one another's problems . and when you do that , you will be amazed at how much progress you can make , and how much healing we can have . because , folks , at the end of the day , the country needs healed . i've heard a lot of hot rhetoric here tonight , but i've got to tell you , as somebody that actually passed a budget ; that paid down a half a trillion dollars of our national debt , you can't do it alone . you've got to bring people together . you've got to give people hope . and together , we can solve these problems that hurt us and heal america . and that is what's so critical for our neighborhoods , our families , our children , and our grandchildren . 
rubio well , there are some people in florida upset at me over a joke i made about florida state , but , what the heck , i want my codename to be gator . laughter 
kasich well , dana , the heritage foundation had this position as well . and when i look at it , i don't think it's tenable . and we don't need to do that . again , i'm telling you that we are going to we have a proposal , a plan that we're enacting now that says if you are a hospital or a doctor and you're providing very high quality at lower prices , below the midpoint some charge high , some charge low . if you are below the midpoint , we are going to give you a financial reward for allowing you to provide services that result in high quality for our people at lower pricess . that is the way in which we are going to damp down the rising costs of healthcare . because if you think about your own deductibles today , they're going higher , higher and higher . and you know what ? at some point , people can't afford it . our plan will work . it uses the market . it uses transparency . it gets the patient in the middle . and guess what ? we're actually doing it in my state , the seventh largest state in the country . and if this will go this will go national , we will get our hands on healthcare where you will know what's going on . we will pay for quality , lower prices , and we will begin to see healthcare become affordable in america and where people will also be able to have health insurance , even if they have a preexisting condition . we don't want to throw millions of people out into the cold and not have the health insurance , dana . so that's really what we're doing . this is not a theory . this is what we are actually doing in our state . we will begin payments next year based on episodes that we have in our lives . if our primary care physicians keep us healthy for a year , with really high quality , guess what ? they will get a financial reward . our primary care physicians need help . they need support . we're losing them . this will allow them to get a reward for doing a great job . 
rubio chris , you didn't want to go back . you didn't want to go back . 
trump they had a responsibility , absolutely . i think we have three of them here . . . 
trump well , first of all , rand paul shouldn't even be on this stage . he's number 11 , he's got 1 percent in the polls , and how he got up here , there's far too many people anyway . as far as temperament and we all know that as far as temperament , i think i have a great temperament . i built a phenomenal business with incredible , iconic assets , one of the really truly great real estate businesses . and i may be an entertainer , because i've had tremendous success with number one bestsellers all over the place , with the apprentice and everything else i've done . but i will tell you this what i am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessman , and that's the kind of mindset this country needs to bring it back , because we owe 19 trillion right now , 19 trillion , and you need this kind of thinking to bring our country back . and believe me , my temperament is very good , very calm . but we will be respected outside of this country . we are not respected now . 
trump he doesn't show up to vote . 
rubio to comply with an order that says that they have to allow the fbi the opportunity to try to guess the password ? 
rubio well , then answer the economy question . 
walker no , no . . . 
trump first of all , you're talking about a border that's many , many times longer . you're talking about a massive border . we have far less problem with that border than we do with our southern border , and tremendous amounts you know , i won , i had the privilege of winning by a landslide , by the way , new hampshire . you go to new hampshire , the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in . and , you wouldn't think this beautiful place it's beautiful . with the trees and the roads , and the countryside . their biggest problem is heroin , and it's such a shame to see it . they're pouring in from the southern border , so i'm talking about great security . i'm talking about a wall that can absolutely be built , and i'll build it on time , on budget . it'll be a very high wall , a great wall . it's going to be built , it's going to be built . it's going to be paid for by canada , by the way maybe i'll get canada to pay ? got to be paid for by mexico . the problem with canada , you're talking about a massively long piece . you're talking about a border that would be about four times longer . it would be very , very hard to do , and we it is not our biggest problem . i don't care what anyone says . it is not our big problem . our big problem is not only people coming in , and in many cases the wrong people , it's the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in . 
trump . . . they blew up hold it . . . . 
cruz what would you do if the bank was failing ? i would not let the people who put their money in there all go down . 
fiorina well , first of all , i must say as i think about that question , i think about a woman i met the other day . i would guess she was 40 years old . she had several children . and she said to me , you know , carly , i go to bed every night afraid for my children's future . and that really struck me . this is america . a mother is going to bed afraid for her children's future . and the reason she's afraid for her children's future is because we've had problems for a long time . yes , problems have gotten much worse under democrats . but the truth is , this government has been growing bigger and bigger , more corrupt , less effective , crushing the engine of economic growth for a very long time . this isn't about just replacing a democrat with a republican now . it's about actually challenging the status quo of big government . big government has created a big business called politics . and there are lots of people invested in the status quo of that big business called politics . specifically , we need actually to do five things to really get this economy going again . we need to go to zero based budgeting so we know where every dollar is being spent , we can challenge any dollar , cut any dollar , move any dollar . we need to actually reform the tax code . go to a three page tax code . yes , there are plans that would reform our tax code to three pages . in addition to rolling back what president obama has done , we need to do a top to bottom review of every single regulation on the books . that hasn't been done in 50 years . we need to pass the reins act so congress is in charge of regulation , not nameless , faceless bureaucrats accountable to no one . we've become a nation of rules , not a nation of laws . and finally we actually , yes , have to hold government officials accountable for their performance . all this has to be done , and the citizens of this nation must help a president fiorina get it done . we must take our government back . 
trump right . 
cruz donald , learn not to interrupt . it's not complicated . 
trump the next day . but i had learned . i mean , nobody had ever asked me the question . this was brand new . but and i really mean it . you have to show a degree of flexibility . if you're going to be one way and you think it's wrong , does that mean the rest of your life you have to go in the wrong direction because you don't want to change ? 
huckabee well , you ask about how we fund it . one of the reasons that social security is in so much trouble is that the only funding stream comes from people who get a wage . the people who get wages is declining dramatically . most of the income in this country is made by people at the top who get dividends and and capital gains . the fairtax transforms the process by which we fund social security and medicare because the money paid in consumption is paid by everybody , including illegals , prostitutes , pimps , drug dealers , all the people timer sounds that are freeloading off the system now . that's why it ought to be a transformed system . 
trump we'll win the case . 
huckabee no , no . let me finish this one thought , jake . i haven't gotten that much time , so i'm going to take just what little i can here . we made accommodation to the fort hood shooter to let him grow a beard . we made accommodations to the detainees at gitmo i've been to gitmo , and i've seen the accommodations that we made to the muslim detainees who killed americans . you're telling me that you cannot make an accommodation for an elected democrat county clerk from rowan county , kentucky ? what else is it other than the criminalization of her faith and the exaltation of the faith of everyone else who might be a fort hood shooter or a detainee at gitmo ? 
trump you know why ? i didn't want to , but he sent me his book with his autograph . . . crosstalk 
rubio the most important job i'm ever going to have , the most important job anyone in this room will ever have , is the job of being a parent . not the job of being president , or the job of being a senator , or the job of being a congressman . the most important job any of us will ever do is the job of being a president sic , because the most important institution in society is the family . if the family breaks down , society breaks down . you can't have a strong nation without strong values , and no one is born with strong values . they have to be taught to you in strong families and reinforced in you in strong communities . and so when we set out to do tax reform , we endeavor to have a pro family tax code , and we endeavor to do it because we know how difficult it is for families in the 21st century to afford the cost of living . it is expensive to raise children in the 21st century , and families that are raising children are raising the future taxpayers of the united states , and everything costs more . in 35 out of 50 states , child care costs more than college . there are millions of people watching this broadcast tonight that understand exactly what i'm talking about . they don't know how they're going to make that payment every month , and if they can't make it , they can't work , because someone needs to watch their kids during the day . they don't know how they're going to save for their kids' future , to go to college . and so , yes , i have a child tax credit increase , and i'm proud of it . i am proud that i have a pro family tax code , because the pro family tax plan i have will strengthen the most important institution in the in the country , the family . 
cruz that's who you've got to be accountable to , the people . 
christie let me tell you something , you go . . . 
kasich well , i worry about the violence at a rally period . i mean , it's you know , elections are important but the unity of this country really matters . jake , here's what i think is happening . there are people out there who are worried about their jobs . they're worried that somebody is going to come in and tell them they're out of work and they're 54 years old and they don't know where they're going to get another job , a man and a woman . maybe they're worried about a trade deal . they're worried about the fact that their wages haven't gone up . they're worried that their kids went to college and the promise was , you go to college , you get a job , things are going to be great . they went to college , they rang up debt and they're still living in their parents' basement . people are uptight . our seniors are worried they're going to lose their social security . there's two ways to treat it . you can either prey on that and be negative about it , or you tell people that these things can be fixed . if we're americans rather than republicans and democrats , we get together , we can solve all of these problems . we can provide financial security , we can drive the wages up , we can get kids jobs with a more robust economy . bell rings and you know what ? they want to help solve these problems right where they live and i'll give them the power to do it . 
rubio and with that money , he lost more money than he made . 
trump it depends on what comes up . you never know . it depends on what comes up . look , look , we had a great president , ronald reagan . we had tip o'neill , speaker . and what do we do , we take these two men that are very , very different men , they got along , they had relationships , and they got things , and very beautifully . nobody is complaining about the deals that ronald reagan made . and he made it with tip o'neill . we need to have people get together and work good deals out , good deals out from our standpoint . and i'll tell you this , it can be done . we don't want to continue to watch people signing executive orders because that was not what the constitution and the brilliant designers of this incredible document had in mind . we need people that can make deals and can work , because right now in washington there's total , absolute gridlock . 
rubio and embrace all of the principles that made us great . 
cruz 
carson you got it . you got it . 
rubio good evening . 
bush she is absolutely the love of my life , and she's right here . . . 
rubio inaudible cheering 
rubio no , it's your record . 
christie see , jake , it wasn't me . laughter 
kasich . . . both places . and i did it including people in the other party . and that's how we were successful . 
rubio i don't know anything about . . . 
trump well . . . 
christie listen , you know , hugh , it's an important point . and the question is , who is going to prosecute hillary clinton ? the obama white house seems to have in interest , the justice department seems to have no interest . i think it's time to put a former federal prosecutor on the same stage as hillary clinton . and i will prosecute her during those debates on that stage for the record we're talking about here . the fact she had a private email server in her basement , using national security secrets running through it , could have been hacked by the russians , the chinese , or two 18 year olds on a toot ph wanting to have some fun . no one is answering that question from the hillary clinton campaign . . . 
trump i was not at all critical of him . i was not at all . in fact , frankly , he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people . they go to harvard . they go to yale . they go to princeton . they come from another country and they're immediately sent out . i am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in silicon valley . 
rubio ok . i know the democrats have the ultimate superpac . it's called the mainstream media who every single day . . . . . . and i'll tell you why . last week , hillary clinton went before a committee . she admitted she had sent e mails to her family saying , hey , this attack at benghazi was caused by al qaida like elements . she spent over a week telling the families of those victims and the american people that it was because of a video . and yet the mainstream media is going around saying it was the greatest week in hillary clinton's campaign . it was the week she got exposed as a liar . it was the week that she got exposed as a liar . . . but she has her super pac helping her out , the american mainstream media . 
trump ted cruz told your brother that he wanted john roberts to be on the united states supreme court . they both pushed him , he twice approved obamacare . 
cruz so you said you'd abandon philosophy and abandon principle . . . 
carson can somebody attack me , please ? laughter and applause 
cruz you know , the people that get forgotten in this debate over immigration are the hardworking men and women of this country our millions of americans who are losing their jobs . millions of legal immigrants who are losing their jobs are seeing their wages driven down . you know , in the past couple of weeks the wall street journal had a very interesting article about the state of arizona . arizona put in very tough laws on illegal immigration , and the result was illegal immigrants fled the state , and what's happened there it was a very interesting article . some of the business owners complained that the wages they had to pay workers went up , and from their perspective that was a bad thing . but , what the state of arizona has seen is the dollars they're spending on welfare , on prisons , and education , all of those have dropped by hundreds of millions of dollars . and , the americans , and for that matter , the legal immigrants who are in arizona , are seeing unemployment drop are seeing wages rise . that's who we need to be fighting for . listen , we have always welcomed legal immigrants , but i think it is a mistake to forgive those who break the law to allow them to become u . s . citizens , and that's why i've led the fight against granting citizenship to those here illegally , and that's why i will do the same thing as president . 
cruz megyn , of course it's an ideological problem , that's one of the reasons i introduce the expatriate terrorist act in the senate that said if any american travels to the middle east and joining isis , that he or she forfeits their citizenship so they don't use a passport to come back and wage jihad on americans . yes , it is ideological , and let me contrast president obama , who at the prayer breakfast , essentially acted as an apologist . he said , well , gosh , the crusades , the inquisitions timer sounds we need a president that shows the courage that egypt's president al sisi did , a muslim , when he called out the radical islamic terrorists who are threatening the world . 
trump well , what's happening right now , neil , is something that not been a subject of conversation by politicians . as primarily the only politician , i guess other than carly on the stage , they haven't talked about a corporate inversion . a corporate inversion companies are leaving . you know , we used to leave new york to go to florida . we got better taxes , we got , maybe , something else . now , they're the united states to go to other countries . they have trillions of dollars in those other countries . they're going for two reasons , they can't get their money back in . it's something where the democrats and the republicans both agree , it's the only thing i can think of . they both agree , let the money come back in . three and a half years , they still can't make a deal . they can't get the money in . it's probably two and a half trillion , but , i think it's much more than that . all of that money could become could come right in and be used to rebuild our country , and investments in our country . they can't do it . what we have to do , and what i've done , is made the tax rate and one of the reasons they don't inaudible the taxes so obnoxious , they can't do it . where , i made it a 10 number , as you know . i've been very highly praised for it . a lot of money's going to come back in , we're going to get rid of the bureaucratic problems , and roadblocks , because that's also a problem . and , we're going to have all of this money pour back into the united states . it's going to be used to build businesses , for jobs , and everything else . and , as i say , my expression is , let's make america great again . 
carson no , it isn't . first of all , let me go back to your first question for me . it wasn't phrased as who gets to nominate supreme court appointees . of course that's the president . so i know that there are some left wing media who would try to make hay on that . secondly , thank you for including me in the debate . two questions already . this is great . now , as far . . . laughter and applause . . . as far as those 2 a . m . phone calls are concerned , judgment is what is required . and the kinds of things that you come up with are sometimes very , very difficult and very unique . one of the things that i was known for is doing things that have not been done before . so no amount of experience really prepares you to do something that has never been done before . that's where judgment comes in . and that , i think , is a situation that we're in right now , a situation that we have never been in before with the kinds of threats that pose real danger to our nation , and it comes in very handy in those situations . 
rubio . . . he's done it again . cheering and applause 
cruz . . . why did you give my campaign and my foundation 100 , 000 ? 
christie well , i wish you would have asked that question years ago when they broke it . i mean , let me be honest with the people who are watching at home . the government has lied to you and they have stolen from you . they told you that your social security money is in a trust fund . all that's in that trust fund is a pile of ious for money they spent on something else a long time ago . and they've stolen from you because now they know they cannot pay these benefits and social security is going to be insolvent in seven to eight years . we're sitting up here talking about all these other things ; 71 percent of federal spending today is on entitlements , and debt service . and , that's with zero percent interest rates . now , i'm the only person that's put out a detailed plan on how to deal with entitlements . and we'll save a trillion dollars over the next 10 years . and , here's the difference between me and hillary clinton . what hillary clinton's going to say , and has said before is , she wants to raise social security taxes . now , let me ask you a question everybody , and , this is for the guy , you know , who owns a landscaping business out there . if somebody's already stolen money from you , are you going to give them more ? or , are you going to deal with the problem by saying , i'm going to give people who've done well in this country less benefit on the backend . we need to get realistic about this . we're not the american people forget about anything else , they've already been lied to and stolen from . and . . . 
cruz hold on . he called me a liar . you're saying i can't respond to being called a liar ? crosstalk 
fiorina first let me say , we have just spent a good bit of time discussing , as republicans , how to solve this problem . i would ask your audience at home to ask a very basic question . why have democrats not solved this problem ? president obama campaigned in 2007 and 2008 on solving the immigration problem . he entered washington with majorities in the house and the senate . he could have chosen to do anything to solve this pro this problem . instead , he chose to do nothing . why ? because the democrats don't want this issue solved . 
kasich country moving again . 
trump i have no problem with it . 
rubio ted , do you . . . 
rubio well , thank you for the question , chris , and it's great to be here tonight . let me begin by saying this i'm not new to the political process ; i was making a contribution as the speaker of the third largest and most diverse state in the country well before i even got into the senate . i would add to that that this election cannot be a resume competition . it's important to be qualified , but if this election is a resume competition , then hillary clinton's gonna be the next president , because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight . here's what this election better be about this election better be about the future , not the past . it better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today , not simply the issues we once faced . this country is facing an economy that has been radically transformed . you know , the largest retailer in the country and the world today , amazon , doesn't even own a single store ? and these changes have been disruptive . they have changed people's lives . the jobs that once sustained our middle class , they either don't pay enough or they are gone , and we need someone that understands that as our nominee . if i'm our nominee , how is hillary clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck ? i was raised paycheck to paycheck . how is she how is she gonna lecture me how is she gonna lecture me about student loans ? i owed over 100 , 000 just four years ago . if i'm our nominee , we will be the party of the future . 
kasich . . . because i don't think it's going to work out . 
christie i don't see a lot of weakness on this stage , quite frankly . where i see the weakness is in those three people that are left on the democratic stage . you know , i see a socialist , an isolationist and a pessimist . and for the sake of me , i can't figure out which one is which . laughter but i will but i will tell you this , the socialist says they're going to pay for everything and give you everything for free , except they don't say they're going to raise it through taxes to 90 percent to do it . the isolationist is the one who wants to continue to follow a foreign policy that has fewer democracies today than when barack obama came into office around the world . but i know who the pessimist is . it's hillary clinton . and you put me on that stage against her next september , she won't get within 10 miles of the white house . take it to the bank . 
trump you do whatever you want . you call it whatever you want . i want to tell you . they lied . they said there were weapons of mass destruction , there were none . and they knew there were none . there were no weapons of mass destruction . booing 
rubio i do support protection for the life of the mother because i'm pro life . i just believe deeply that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws . if i'm president and there's a bill that's passed that saves lives but it has exceptions , i'll sign it . but i do believe deeply that all human life is worthy of the protection of laws . i've already said , for me , the issue of life is not a political issue and i want to be frank . i would rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue of life . 
bush ask yourself , which candidate will keep you and our country safer , stronger and freer ? hillary clinton has aligned herself with barack obama on isis , iran and the economy . it's an alliance doomed to fail . my proven record suggests that my detailed plans will fortify our national and economic security . and my proven record as governor makes will give you a sense that i don't make false promises . i deliver real results . for america to be safe and sound , i ask for you support . thank you all very much . 
rubio i'm sorry , but let me finish my . . . 
rubio . . . will be very reasonable and responsible about what you do with someone who's been here and isn't a criminal . if you're a criminal , obviously , you will not be able to stay . 
rubio that's a great question . 
kasich well , i i do believe we contribute to climate change , but i don't think it has to be a , you know , either you're for some environmental stringent rules or , you know , you're not going to have any jobs . the fact is , you can have both . in our state , we've reduced emissions by 30 percent . but let me tell you also what we're trying to do . we want all the sources of energy . we want to dig coal , but we want to clean it when we burn it . we believe in natural gas . we believe in nuclear power . and you know what else i believe in ? i happen to believe in solar energy , wind energy , efficiency , renewables matter . now , it doesn't mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment , because we don't know how much humans actually contribute . but it is important we develop renewables . battery technology can unleash an entirely different world . so the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another . 
trump inaudible . 
bush no , it doesn't , and that's the problem . the lack of leadership in this country by barack obama , john kerry , hillary clinton , thinking that this is a policy that works , this policy of containment with isis . it's a complete , unmitigated disaster . and to allow russia now to have influence in syria makes it harder , but we need to destroy isis and dispose of assad to create a stable syria so that the four million refugees aren't a breeding ground for islamic jihadists . this is the problem . donald trump brought up the fact that he would he'd want to accommodate russia . russia is not taking out isis . they're they're attacking our our our team , the team that we've been training and the team that we've been supporting . it is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that russia could be a positive partner in this . they are on the run . they are making every time we step back , they're on the run . the question that you asked was a really good one about what you would do what three things would you do . i would restore the military , the sequester needs to be reversed . i would have a strategy to destroy isis , and i would immediately create a policy of containment as it relates to iran's ambitions , and to make it make clear that we are not going to allow for iran to do what it's doing , which is to move towards a nuclear weapon . those three things would be the first and foremost things that we need to do . . . bell rings . . . in 2017 . 
rubio he can start tonight by announcing that all the donald trump clothing will no longer be made in china and in mexico , but will be made here in the united states . and on the issue of job creation , i find this interesting . the private sector creates jobs . the jobs of those of us in public service are to put in place policies that allow the economy to grow . that's the problem with the democratic party . they think government is what creates jobs . government does not create jobs . now , the way you create jobs is you make america the easiest and the best place in the world to start a business or to expand an existing business . if you go on my website , marcorubio . com , you will see a real plan to fix our taxes , to roll back regulations , to repeal and replace obamacare , not just lines around the states . serious policies and proposals . 
cruz and i will do everything necessary to keep our children safe . 
trump . . . first of all , let me just tell you something and you know , because you just saw the numbers yourself nbc wall street journal just came out with a poll headline trump way up , cruz going down . i mean , so don't so you can't you can't . . . booing . . . they don't like the wall street journal . they don't like nbc , but i like the poll . laughter and frankly , it just came out , and in iowa now , as you know , ted , in the last three polls , i'm beating you . so you know , you shouldn't misrepresent how well you're doing with the polls . you don't have to say that . in fact , i was all for you until you started doing that , because that's a misrepresentation , number one . number two , this isn't me saying it . i don't care . i think i'm going to win fair and square inaudible to win this way . thank you . lawrence tribe and inaudible from harvard of harvard , said that there is a serious question as to whether or not ted can do this . ok ? there are other attorneys that feel , and very , very fine constitutional attorneys , that feel that because he was not born on the land , he cannot run for office . here's the problem . we're running . we're running . he does great . i win . i choose him as my vice presidential candidate , and the democrats sue because we can't take him along for the ride . i don't like that . ok ? laughter the fact is and if for some reason he beats the rest of the field , he beats the rest of the field inaudible . see , they don't like that . they don't like that . audience booing no , they don't like he beats the rest of the field , because they want me . laughter but if for some reason , neil , he beats the rest of the field , i already know the democrats are going to be bringing a suit . you have a big lawsuit over your head while you're running . and if you become the nominee , who the hell knows if you can even serve in office ? so you should go out , get a declaratory judgment , let the courts decide . and you shouldn't have mentioned the polls because i would have been much . . . crosstalk 
trump every major business leader has used the i never went bankrupt , by the way , as you know , everybody knows . but we hundreds of companies , hundreds of deals , i've used ? ? ? . . . into bankruptcy . that's what's wrong with politicians in washington right now . they think we can take a country into bankruptcy . crosstalk 
paul megyn , may i respond ? may i respond ? 
trump he's a nasty guy . 
rubio well , i think you can be flexible about ideas , you shouldn't be flexible about your principles . about when it comes to ideas and working with people , i have a record of having done that . listen , on the issue of higher education , i'm the only one that continually talks about student loan debt because i owed over 100 , 000 of student loan debt . so i know this is a major issue . and all my ideas that deal with higher education are bipartisan . the va accountability act that i passed i did it on a on a bipartisan basis . the sanctions that i helped that i imposed on hezbollah i did it on a bipartisan basis . the girls count act that deals with human trafficking , we did that on a bipartisan basis . but i also want to be frank . there are issues we're going to have to have an election over . when it comes to repealing and replaces obamacare , that's not going to be bipartisan . when it comes to reducing the tax burdens on americans , that's not going to be bipartisan . when it comes to shrinking the size of the federal bureaucracy , that's probably not going to be bipartisan . there are issues we can work together on and we should , but there are fundamental issues about the proper role of government . and on those issues , i will fight anyone who wants to expand government , raise taxes , or weaken our military . 
cruz you want to go . . . crosstalk 
trump well , i also happened to call him a lightweight , ok ? and i have said that . so i would like to take that back . he is really not that much of a lightweight . and as far as and i have to say this , i have to say this . he hit my hands . nobody has ever hit my hands . i have never heard of this . look at those hands . are they small hands ? laughter and he referred to my hands , if they are small , something else must be small . i guarantee you there is no problem . i guarantee . 
trump look . . . . . . when i announced that i was running for president on june 16th , illegal immigration wasn't even a subject . if i didn't bring it up , we wouldn't even be talking . now , i don't often agree with marco , and i don't often agree with ted , but i can in this case . the weakest person on this stage by far on illegal immigration is jeb bush . they come out of an act of love , whether you like it or not . he is so weak on illegal immigration it's laughable , and everybody knows it . 
christie and and , megyn ? megyn , that's a that , you know , that's a completely ridiculous answer . i want to collect more records from terrorists , but less records from other people . how are you supposed to know , megyn ? 
kasich . . . an agreement with the . . . crosstalk 
bush look , the the simple fact is that my plan actually gives the middle class the greatest break 2 , 000 per family . and if you make 40 , 000 a year , a family of four , you don't pay any income tax at all . simplifying the code and lowering rates , both for corporations and and personal rates , is exactly what we need to do . you think about the regulatory cost and the tax cost that's why small businesses are closing , rather than being formed in our country right now . the big corporations have the scale to deal with all of this . and what i think all of us are saying is , our monetary policy , our tax policy , regulatory policy needs to be radically changed so we can create high sustained growth for income to rise . the government has tried it their way . under under barack obama and the proposals of hillary clinton and bernie sanders and others , they've tried it their way , and it has failed miserably . we need to take a new approach of taxing reforming how we tax , and reforming the regulations in our in our country before it's too late . 
kasich well , folks , i've done now over 100 town hall meetings and i've loved every second of it . it has been the greatest thing in the world . and i want you to know that you've changed me , because i've listened to your stories and i've had your hugs and i've seen your tears , and i've seen you walk away and say , i now have hope . you know , i've had a conservative message , but a positive message not just a conservative message , but a positive message about how we can bring people together , how we can restore america's strength , lift everyone . new hampshire , please give me a chance to carry this message forward to the united states of america . and then , i will come back . thank you , loved it . and god bless you . 
rubio thirty seconds . 
paul the question is , how do we keep america safe from terrorism ? trump says we ought to close that internet thing . the question really is , what does he mean by that ? like they do in north korea ? like they do in china ? rubio says we should collect all americans' records all of the time . the constitution says otherwise . i think they're both wrong . i think we defeat terrorism by showing them that we do not fear them . i think if we ban certain religions , if we censor the internet , i think that at that point the terrorists will have won . regime change hasn't won . toppling secular dictators in the middle east has only led to chaos and the rise of radical islam . i think if we want to defeat terrorism , i think if we truly are sincere about defeating terrorism , we need to quit arming the allies of isis . if we want to defeat terrorism , the boots on the ground the boots on the ground need to be arab boots on the ground . as commander in chief , i will do whatever it takes to defend america . but in defending america , we cannot lose what america stands for . today is the bill of rights' anniversary . i hope we will remember that and cherish that in the fight on terrorism . 
cruz thank you , wolf . 
kasich he must go . it will be a blow to iran and russia . 
trump . . . but it was elevated to an a . . . 
trump yes . ok , good . it looked like he was looking right at me , right there . i think that i look at what's going on , i look at all of the polls , i do very , very well against hillary clinton . i can tell you , i'm the last person that she wants to run against . and i think you can see what we've done in terms of galvanizing . i've been all over the country . we're last night , i was in south carolina , we had 12 , 000 people . it set up in about four days . we have galvanized and we've created a movement . a lot of it has to do with as an example , josh's question on drugs . i'm the first person that said , build a wall . but i mean , a real wall , not a toy wall like they have right now . a real wall . and you'll solve lots of problems . but we will galvanize the people of this country , and we will beat hillary clinton . because assuming that she runs , by the way , how she gets away with the e mail stuff is hard to believe . so , i don't know that she's going to be running . but on the assumption she runs . . . i mean , look . and speaking of that , if she runs , she's running for one reason . she's going to be able to run for one reason , and that's because the democrats are protecting her . because so many people have done so much less than her , and they were absolutely their lives have been destroyed . but on the assumption they do protect her , i will win the election and we will win it by a lot . we will win it handily . we cannot have another four years of essentially barack obama . 
huckabee and the reason barack obama has been dangerous to this country and we better elect someone who had some executive experience , is because we cannot afford another eight years having a person in the office who doesn't know what he does not know . 
trump well , let let me just say let me just say , first of all , i have great respect for justice scalia . i thought he was terrific . and if you talk about evolving , ronald reagan was a somewhat liberal democrat . ronald reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative more importantly , he was a great president . a great president . as far as planned parenthood is concerned , i'm pro life . i'm totally against abortion , having to do with planned parenthood . but millions and millions of women cervical cancer , breast cancer are helped by planned parenthood . so you can say whatever you want , but they have millions of women going through planned parenthood that are helped greatly . and i wouldn't fund it . i would defund it because of the abortion factor , which they say is 3 percent . i don't know what percentage it is . they say it's 3 percent . but i would defund it , because i'm pro life . but millions of women are helped by planned parenthood . 
trump why does she keep interrupting everybody ? laughter terrible . booing
