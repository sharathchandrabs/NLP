sanders madam secretary , when he asked me to speak . . . 
sanders too many lives have been destroyed because people possessed marijuana , millions over a 30 year period . and that is why i believe we should take marijuana out of the federal controlled substance act . 
sanders . . . well and i . . . 
sanders look , the secretary is right . this is a terribly complicated issue . there are no simple solutions . but where we have a disagreement is that i think if you look at the history of regime changes , you go back to mossadegh in iran , you go back to salvador allende who we overthrew in chile , you go back to overthrowing saddam hussein in iraq , you go back to where we are today in syria with a dictator named assad . the truth is it is relatively easy for a powerful nation like america to overthrow a dictator but it is very hard to predict the unintended consequences and the turmoil and the instability that follows after you overthrow that dictator . so i think secretary clinton and i have a fundamental disagreement . i'm not quite the fan of regime change that i believe she is . 
sanders well , hillary clinton , and everybody else who supported these disastrous trade policies . she wasn't alone . we have many , many republicans and far too many democrats who supported these disastrous trade policies . do you know . . . . . . do you know that in 1960 detroit michigan was one of the wealthiest cities in america ? flint , michigan was a prosperous city , but then what happened is corporate america said why do i want to pay somebody in michigan a living wage when i can pay slave wages in mexico or china ? we're going to shut down , we're going to move abroad , we're going to bring those products back into this country . those trade policies , as much as any other set of policies , has resulted in the shrinking of the american middle class . and , i'll tell you what else it did . it's not only job loss by the millions , it is the race to the bottom so that new jobs in manufacturing , in some cases today , pay 50 percent less than they did 20 years ago . how stupid is that trade policy ? 
clinton that has , unfortunately , been in many ways , moved to a lower priority . i will elevate it , and i will do everything i can . water , soil , and paint . . . 
sanders you know , franklin delano roosevelt took the oath of office in 1933 at a time when 25 percent of the american people were unemployed , country was in incredible despair . and he stood before the american people and he said , the only thing we have to fear is fear itself , a profound statement that gave the american people the courage to believe that , yes , we could get out of that terrible depression . and then what he did is redefine the role of government . you know , you had herbert hoover before that saying , no , we got to only worry about the deficit . so what if mass unemployment exists ? so what if children are going hungry ? that's not the role of the government . and when fdr said , yeah , it is , that we're going to use all of the resources that we have to create jobs , to build homes , to feed people , to protect the farmers , we are a nation which if we come together there is nothing that we could not accomplish . and kind of that's what i see our campaign is about right now . in this particular moment of serious crises , saying to the american people don't give up on the political process . don't listen to the trumps of the world and allowing them to divide us . if we reengage and get involved , yeah , we can have health care for all people , we can make public colleges and universities tuition free . we do not have to have massive levels of income and wealth inequality . in the same light , as the foreign leader , winston churchill's politics were not my politics . he was kind of a conservative guy in many respects . but nobody can deny that as a wartime leader , he rallied the british people when they stood virtually alone against the nazi juggernaut and rallied them and eventually won an extraordinary victory . those are two leaders that i admire very much . 
clinton . . . really hard to do if you don't have early childhood education . . . 
clinton well senator , let me just correct the record if i can . you knowlet me correct the record . crosstalk 
clinton that turning over our white house to the republicans would be bad for everybody especially young people . 
o'malley yes , this one falls under the category of , i have actually done this . as a governor we actually made the greater investments so that we could go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuition . my plan actually goes further than senator sanders because a big chunk of the cost is actually room and board and books and fees . so as a nation we need to increase what we invest in pell grants . yes , we need to make it easier for parents to refinance . but states need to do more as well . and i propose a block grant program that will keep the states in the game as well . i believe that all of our kids should go into an income based repayment plan . i'm joined tonight by two daughters , tara and grace . my oldest daughter's a teacher . um , and their mother's here as well . we were proud of them on graduation day , weren't we , katie ? and we're going to be proud every month for the rest of our lives . i mean , we had to borrow so much money to send them to college and were not the only ones . there're families all across america who aren't able to contribute to our economy because of this crushing student loan . i also propose that we can pay for this with a tax on high volume trades and we need to because my dad came to college after world war ii on a g . i . bill . but today , we're the only nation on the planet that's saddling our kids with a lifetime of bills . that's a drag on the economy . it's one of the key investments we need to make . i was flattered that secretary clinton two months later borrowed so many of my proposals to incorporate into hers . and in our party , unlike the republican party , we actually believe that the more our people learn , the more they will earn and higher education should be a right for every kid . 
sanders but what my parents did accomplish is they were able to send both of their sons to college . we were the first in the family . so i know something about economic anxiety and living in a family does not have sufficient income . and that is why i am pledged , if elected president of the united states , to bring about a political revolution where millions of people begin to stand up and finally say enough is enough , this great country and our government belong to all of us , not just a handful of billionaires . thank you very much . 
clinton i would not want to go to that point . i would hope that , given the extraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs and questions from law enforcement , that there could be a manhattan like project , something that would bring the government and the tech communities together to see they're not adversaries , they've got to be partners . it doesn't do anybody any good if terrorists can move toward encrypted communication that no law enforcement agency can break into before or after . there must be some way . i don't know enough about the technology , martha , to be able to say what it is , but i have a lot of confidence in our tech experts . and maybe the back door is the wrong door , and i understand what apple and others are saying about that . but i also understand , when a law enforcement official charged with the responsibility of preventing attacks to go back to our early questions , how do we prevent attacks well , if we can't know what someone is planning , we are going to have to rely on the neighbor or , you know , the member of the mosque or the teacher , somebody to see something . 
clinton well , first of all , it isn't the middle class . i have made very clear that hardworking , middle class families need a raise , not a tax increase . in fact , wages adjusted for inflation haven't risen since the turn of the last century , after my husband's administration . so we have a lot of work to do to get jobs going again , get incomes rising again . and i have laid out specific plans you can go to my web site , hillaryclinton . com , and read the details . and i will pay for it by , yes , taxing the wealthy more , closing corporate loopholes , deductions , and other kinds of favorable treatment . and i can do it without raising the debt , without raising taxes on the middle class and making it reasonably manageable within our budget so that we can be fiscally responsible at the same time . 
clinton . . . you know though , i guess senator sanders , that the koch brothers , as you said , are sensible with how they use their money . and i agree with you . they stand for things that i find abhorrent , that would be bad for our country , bad for our future . but they did just put up a little video praising you for being the only democrat who stood with the republicans to try to eliminate the export import bank , which has helped hundreds and hundreds of companies here in florida be able to export their goods and employ more floridians . so from my perspective , you sided with the koch brothers . 
sanders you may recall way back in , when was it , 1961 , they invaded cuba , and everybody was totally convinced that castro was the worst guy in the world . all the cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against fidel castro . they forgot that he educated their kids , gave them health care , totally transformed their society . end video clip 
sanders well , secretary clinton was right and what i did which i think is also right , is demanded the resignation of governor . a man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power . now , we are a great nation and we've heard a lot of great ideas here tonight . let's be honest and let's be truthful . very little is going to be done to transform our economy and to create the kind of middle class we need unless we end a corrupt campaign finance system which is undermining american democracy . we've got to get rid of super pacs , we've got to get rid of citizens' united and what we've got to do is create a political revolution which revitalizes american democracy ; which brings millions of young people and working people into the political process . to say loudly and clearly , that the government of the united states of america belongs to all of us and not just a handful of wealthy campaign contributors . 
sanders right . 
sanders no , i think the idea was that president then senator obama was wrong for suggesting that it is a good idea to talk to your opponents . it's easier to talk to your friends . it's harder to talk to your enemies . i think we should do both . 
clinton i would stop . . . 
clinton well , first of all , we got a lot of business done with the russians when medvedev was the president , and not putin . we got a nuclear arms deal , we got the iranian sanctions , we got an ability to bring important material and equipment to our soldiers in afghanistan . there's no doubt that when putin came back in and said he was going to be president , that did change the relationship . we have to stand up to his bullying , and specifically in syria , it is important and i applaud the administration because they are engaged in talks right now with the russians to make it clear that they've got to be part of the solution to try to end that bloody conflict . and , to provide safe zones so that people are not going to have to be flooding out of syria at the rate they are . and , i think it's important too that the united states make it very clear to putin that it's not acceptable for him to be in syria creating more chaos , bombing people on behalf of assad , and we can't do that if we don't take more of a leadership position , which is what i'm advocating . 
o'malley and juan carlos juan carlos . . . 
clinton i think it's un american . i think what he has promoted is not at all in keeping with american values , karen . and i am going to take every opportunity to criticize him , to raise those issues . i'm not going to engage in the kind of language that he uses . i think we can make the case against him if he is the nominee , by pointing out what he has said . what he claims to believe in the values he's promoting and i think that's a better way for the american people to draw their conclusions . 
clinton . . . let me just say . . . 
sanders yes . 
clinton but you would index it you would index it to the median wage . of course , you would . do the 12 and you would index it . but i . . . 
o'malley i believe that nuclear iran remains the biggest threat , along with the threat of isil ; climate change , of course , makes cascading threats even more inaudible . 
clinton . . . and that's what i will do as president . . . 
clinton you know , we we agree that we've got to get unaccountable money out of politics . we agree that wall street should never be allowed to wreck main street again . but here's the point i want to make tonight . i am not a single issue candidate , and i do not believe we live in a single issue country . i think that a lot of what we have to overcome to break down the barriers that are holding people back , whether it's poison in the water of the children of flint , or whether it's the poor miners who are being left out and left behind in coal country , or whether it is any other american today who feels somehow put down and oppressed by racism , by sexism , by discrimination against the lgbt community , against the kind of efforts that need to be made to root out all of these barriers , that's what i want to take on . and here in wisconsin , i want to reiterate we've got to stand up for unions and working people who have done it before . . . . . . the american middle class , and who are being attacked by ideologues , by demagogues . yes , does wall street and big financial interests , along with drug companies , insurance companies , big oil , all of it , have too much influence ? you're right . but if we were to stop that tomorrow , we would still have the indifference , the negligence that we saw in flint . we would still have racism holding people back . we would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay . we would still have lgbt people who get married on saturday and get fired on monday . and we would still have governors like scott walker and others trying to rip out the heart of the middle class by making it impossible to organize and stand up for better wages and working conditions . so i'm going to keep talking about tearing down all the barriers that stand in the way of americans fulfilling their potential , because i don't think our country can live up to its potential unless we give a chance to every single american to live up to theirs . 
sanders we haven't come up with an exact number yet , but it will not be as high as the number under dwight d . eisenhower , which was 90 percent . but it will be . . . laughter i'm not that much of a socialist compared to eisenhower . but but we are going to end the absurdity , as warren buffet often remind us . 
sanders we have got to come forward with a consensus that in fact will work . 
clinton yes . 
clinton it's a big difference . first of all , as i understand him , he's talking about a very tall wall . laughter right ? a beautiful tall wall . the most beautiful tall wall , better than the great wall of china , that would run the entire border . that he would somehow magically get the mexican government to pay for . and , you know , it's just fantasy . and in fact , if he cared to know anything about what members of congress , like the senator and i have done , where it was necessary , we did support some fencing . where it was necessary , we did add border patrol agents . we have done what by any fair estimate would have to conclude is a good job , quote , securing the border . so let's get about the business of comprehensive immigration reform . 
sanders i'm going to respond . . . 
clinton it will actually raise wages . you have to make all those connections so that you've got people with you every step of the way . that's what i want to do . 
sanders but during that same period , '96 . there was a bill called so called , it had a long title to it , welfare reform bill . and this bill really was a bill that scapegoated the poorest people in this country . i strongly opposed that legislation . secretary clinton had a different position then . and what that legislation ended up doing is increasing extreme poverty , the poorest people in this country have become much poorer as a result of that really a bill that was written by republicans . bad bill . 
o'malley john , the world is a very dangerous place , but the world is not too dangerous of a place for the united states of america , provided we act according to our principles , provided we act intelligently . i mean , let's talk about this arc of instability that secretary clinton talked about . libya is now a mess . syria is a mess . iraq is a mess . afghanistan is a mess . as americans , we have shown ourselves to have the greatest military on the face of the planet , but we are not so very good at anticipating threats and appreciating just how difficult it is to build up stable democracies , to make the investments and sustainable development that we must as a nation if we are to attack the root causes of these sorts of instability . and i wanted to add one other thing , john , and i think it's important for all of us on this stage . i was in burlington , iowa . and a mom of a service member of ours who served two duties in iraq said , governor o' malley , please , when you're with your other candidates and colleagues on stage , please don't use the term 'boots on the ground' . let's don't use the term 'boots on the ground' . my son is not a pair of boots on the ground . these are american soldiers and we fail them when we fail to take into account what happens the day after a dictator falls and when we fail to act with a whole of government approach with sustainable development , diplomacy , and our economic power in alignment with our principles . 
clinton . . . we did unify the party , and we did elect a democratic president . . . 
sanders let's . . . 
sanders . . . here is the main two points . . . 
sanders david . . . 
sanders well , i don't see it quite like that . 
o'malley john , may i may i interject here ? secretary clinton also said we it was not just the invasion of iraq which secretary clinton voted for and has since said was a big mistake and , indeed , it was . but it was also the cascading effects that followed that . it was also the disbanding of many elements of the iraqi army that are now showing up as part of isis . it was country after country without making the investment in human intelligence to understand who the new leaders were and the new forces were that are coming up . we need to be much more far thinking in this new 21st century era of of nation state failures and conflict . it's not just about getting rid of a single dictator . it is about understanding the secondary and third consequences that fall next . 
sanders well , you don't it all out tomorrow . and you certainly don't phase nuclear out tomorrow . but this is what you do do . what you do do is say that we are going to have a massive program and i had introduced introduced legislation for 10 million solar rooftops . we can put probably millions of people to work retrofitting and weatherizing buildings all over this country . cheering saving rebuilding our rail system . our mass transit system . if we approach this , errol , as if we were literally at a war you know , in 1941 , under franklin delano roosevelt , we moved within three years , within three more years to rebuild our economy to defeat nazism and japanese imperialism . that is exactly the kind of approach we need right now . 
clinton well , we have an authorization to use military force against terrorists . we passed it after 9 11 . 
clinton . . . the republicans want to give them more power , and repeal dodd frank . that's what we need to stop . . . 
clinton that is not what i've heard . let me leave it at that . 
o'malley john , i think somewhere between . . . 
sanders i think we have got to be clear , not equivocate , 15 in minimum wage in 50 states in this country as soon as possible . 
clinton i did answer the . . . 
clinton well , my plan is more comprehensive . and frankly , it's tougher because of course we have to deal with the problem that the banks are still too big to fail . we can never let the american taxpayer and middle class families ever have to bail out the kind of speculative behavior that we saw . but we also have to worry about some of the other players aig , a big insurance company ; lehman brothers , an investment bank . there's this whole area called shadow banking . that's where the experts tell me the next potential problem could come from . 
sanders chuck , actually we looked at it , but it turns out to be a disaster . the way it is structured right now , if you make it all the way to california , you could do pretty well . but in terms of the early statesiowa , new hampshire , the other statesit just doesn't work . your point is well taken . i believe in public funding of elections , absolutely . but this system isi don't know if the secretary would agreeis currently very antiquated and no longer applies to modern day politics . 
o'malley so david , the conclusion of all of those things is this ; they weren't hopes , they weren't dreams , they weren't amorphous goals out there . we actually took action to do these things and as president , i have put forward 15 strategic goals that will make wages go up again for all american families . universal national service is an option for every kid in america to cut youth employment . and i'm the only candidate on this stage to put forward a new agenda for america's cities so we can employ more people in the heart of great american cities and get them back to work . 
sanders it's not going to happen tomorrow . and it's probably not going to happen until we have real campaign finance reform and get rid of all these superpacs , and the power of the insurance companies and the drug companies . but at the end of the day , nancy , here is the question in this great country of ours , with so much intelligence and so much capability , why do we remain the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right ? why do we continue to get ripped off by the drug companies who can charge us any prices they want ? why is it that we are spending per capita far , far more than canada , which is 100 miles away from my door , that guarantees health care to all people ? it will not happen tomorrow . but when millions of people stand up and are prepared to take on the insurance companies and the drug companies , it will happen , and i will lead that effort . medicare for all , single payer system is the way we should go . 
clinton so . . . 
clinton . . . on what the next crisis could be . 
sanders a couple of years ago , when we understood that veterans were not getting the quality care they needed in the timely manner , i worked with folks like john mccain and others to pass the most comprehensive veteran's health care legislation in modern history . but let me rephrase your question because i think , in all do respect , you're expression . in all do respect , you're missing the main point . and the main point in the congress , it's not the republicans and democrats hate each other . that's a mythology from the media . the real issue is that congress is owned by big money and refuses to do what the american people want them to do . the real issue is that in area after area , raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour . the american people want it . rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure , creating 13 million jobs , the american people want it . the pay equity for women , the american people want it . demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes . the american people want it . 
clinton i just think there's got to be a way , and i would hope that our tech companies would work with government to figure that out . otherwise , law enforcement is blind blind before , blind during , and , unfortunately , in many instances , blind after . so we always have to balance liberty and security , privacy and safety , but i know that law enforcement needs the tools to keep us safe . and that's what i hope , there can be some understanding and cooperation to achieve . 
sanders no , i think they won't . laughter and applause so hillary and i have a difference . the ceos of large multinationals may like hillary . they ain't going to like me and wall street is going to like me even less . and the reason for that is we've got to deal with the elephant in the room , which is the greed , recklessness and illegal behavior on wall street . when you have six financial institutions in this country that issue two thirds of the credit cards and one third of the mortgages , when three out of four of them are larger today than when we bailed them out because they are too big to fail , we've got to re establish glass steagall , we have got to break the large financial institutions up . 
clinton well , i think what the president understands , and what he's trying to do , is that we have to support the arab and kurdish fighters on the ground who are actually doing the fighting . i agree with the president . i've said myself , we will not send american combat troops back to either syria or iraqthat is off the table . but we do have special forces , we do have trainers , we do have the military personnel who are helping with the airstrikes that the united states is leading so that we can try to take out isis infrastructure , take out their leadership . and i think that , given the threat that isis poses to the region and beyond , as we have sadly seen in our own country , it is important to keep the iraqi army on a path where they can actually take back territory , to work with the sunni tribes in anbar province and elsewhere so that their fighters can be also deployed , to work with the kurds to provide them the support , but they're doing the fighting . we're doing the support and enabling . and i also think we've got to do more to stop foreign fighters , foreign funding and take isis on online , as well as doing everything necessary to keep us safe at home . so as i look at what the president it doing , it adds up to me . we just have to keeptry to get more support for those people on the ground in syria and iraq who have to actually physically take the territory back . 
sanders yeah , i do . i agree with much of what the secretary said , but , madam secretary , it is not one streak . wall street is an entity of unbelievable economic and political power . that's a fact . and , i want to say something , and it may sound harsh , not to you , but to the american people . in a sense , in my view , the business model of wall street is fraud . it's fraud . i believe that corruption is rampant , and the fact that major bank after major bank has reached multi billion dollar settlements with the united states government when we have a weak regulator system tells me that not only did we have to bail them out once , if we don't start breaking them up , we're going to have to bail them out again , and i do not want to see that happen . . . 
clinton . . . i've always had . 
sanders . . . largest banks in america are much bigger than they were when we bailed them out for being too big to fail , we have got to break them up . 
clinton that's not fair . he's a progressive economist . crosstalk 
clinton no . 
sanders so i don't think . . . . . . having said that , i don't think i'm going to get a whole lot of campaign contributions from wall street . i don't have a super pac . i don't want campaign contributions from corporate america . and let me be clear while there are some great corporations creating jobs and trying to do the right thing , in my view and i say this very seriously the greed of the billionaire class , the greed of wall street is destroying this economy and is destroying the lives of millions of americans . we need an economy that works for the middle class , not just a handful of billionaires , and i will fight and lead to make that happen . 
sanders 27 a contribution . . . 
o'malley . . . our promise . 
sanders i have introduced . . . 
clinton i can't speak for the koch brothers , you're referring to a super pac that we don't coordinate with , that was set up to support president obama , that has now decided that they want to support me . they are the ones who should respond to any questions . let's talk about our campaigns . i'm very proud of the fact that we have more than 750 thousand donors , and the vast majority of them are giving small contributions . so , i'm proud of senator sanders , and his supporters . i think it's great that senator sanders , president obama and i have more donors than any three people who have every run , certainly on the democratic side . that's the way it should be , and i'm going to continue to reach out to thank all my online contributors for everything they are doing for me , to encourage them and help me do more just as senator sanders is . i think that is the real key here . we both have a lot of small donors . i think that sets us apart from a lot of what's happening right now on the republican side . the koch brothers have a very clear political agenda . it is an agenda , in my view , that would do great harm to our country . we're going to fight it as hard as we can , and we're going to fight whoever the republicans nominate who will depend on the koch brothers , and others . 
chafee and then we can help the middle class and hard earning americans hard working americans . 
sanders let me respond to . . . 
sanders that billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers . that makes no sense at all . there has to be real tax reform , and the wealthiest and large corporations will pay when i'm president . 
sanders what being part of the establishment is , is , in the last quarter , having a super pac that raised 15 million from wall street , that throughout one's life raised a whole lot of money from the drug companies and other special interests . to my mind , if we do not get a handle on money in politics and the degree to which big money controls the political process in this country , nobody is going to bring about the changes that is needed in this country for the middle class and working families . 
clinton no , i don't . i think that it was necessary to make sure that we were able after 9 11 to put in place the security that we needed . and it is true that it did require that there be a process . what happened , however , is that the bush administration began to chip away at that process . and i began to speak out about their use of warrantless surveillance and the other behavior that they engaged in . we always have to keep the balance of civil liberties , privacy and security . it's not easy in a democracy , but we have to keep it in mind . 
o'malley nancy , the blueprint in maryland that we followed was yes , we did in fact raise the sales tax by a penny and we made our public schools the best public schools in america for five years in a row with that investment . and yes , we did ask everyone the top 14 percent of earners in our state to pay more in their income tax and we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny's increase to college tuitions . so while other candidates will talk about the things they would like to do , i actually got these things done in a state that defended not only a aaa bond rating , but the highest median income in america . i believe that we pay for many of the things that we need to do again as a nation , investing in the skills of our people , our infrastructure , and research and development and also climate change by the elimination of one big entitlement that we can no longer afford as a people , and that is the entitlement that many of our super wealthiest citizens feel they are entitled to pay namely , a much lower income tax rate and a lower tax rate on capital gains . i believe capital gains , for the most part , should be taxed the same way we tax income from hard work , sweat , and toil . and if we do those things , we can be a country that actually can afford debt free college again . 
clinton if i could just follow up on that . there is no disagreement between us on universal coverage for health care , the disagreement is where do we start from and where do we end up . the republicans want to repeal the affordable care act , i want to improve it . i want to build on it , get the costs down , get prescription drug costs down . senator sanders wants us to start all over again . this was a major achievement of president obama , of our country . it is helping people right now . i am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding . let's make the affordable care act work for everybody . 
sanders every inaudible democrat and senator in support of this proposal introduced by your good friend and my good friend , kirsten gillibrand , rosa delauro , that is the legislation out there that will finally provide family and medical leave . 
sanders as a senator from a rural state , what i can tell secretary clinton , that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what i would hope all of us want , and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are seeing . i believe that there is a consensus in this country . a consensus has said we need to strengthen and expand instant background checks , do away with this gun show loophole , that we have to address the issue of mental health , that we have to deal with the strawman purchasing issue , and that when we develop that consensus , we can finally , finally do something to address this issue . 
clinton you know , the person who first put out the idea of a 50 state party strategy is former governor howard dean , who is with us tonight . and i'm very proud and grateful to have the support of so many elected vermonters and former officials . two former governors , the current governor , the current other senator . i really appreciate that . and i think it's because they've worked with me , they've seen what i do . they know what kind of a colleague i am . they want me as their partner in the white house . and that's exactly what i will do . we'll get things done together . democrats , republicans , independents , we're going to make progress together when i'm president . 
o'malley well , actually , you know , we had this conversation . and i will share with you that i've traveled all around the country , anderson , and there's two phrases i keep hearing again and again and again . and they're the phrases new leadership and getting things done . we cannot be this dissatisfied with our gridlocked national politics and an economy where 70 percent of us are earning the same or less than we were 12 years ago , and think that a resort to old names is going to move us forward . i respect what secretary clinton and her husband have done for our country . but our country needs new leadership to move forward . 
clinton well , they're glitches because . . . 
o'malley have you ever been to the eastern shore ? have you ever been to western maryland ? we were able to pass this and still respect the hunting traditions of people who live in our rural areas . 
clinton it is . because part of this is the startup challenges that this system is facing . we have fought , as democrats , for decades to get a health care plan . i know . i've got the scars to show from the effort back in the early '90s . we want to build on it and fix it . and i'm confident we can do that . and it will have effects in the private market . and one of the reasons in some states why the percentage cost has gone up so much is because governors there would not extend medicaid . and so people are still going to get health care , thankfully , in emergency rooms , in hospitals . those costs are then added to the overall cost , which does increase the insurance premiums for people in the private system . crosstalk 
sanders well , for a start , we're going to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour . and number two , while it is true we may end up paying a few cents more for a hamburger in mcdonald's , at the end of the day , what this economy desperately needs is to rebuild our manufacturing sector with good paying jobs . we cannot continue to sustain the loss of millions of decent paying jobs that we have seen over the last 20 , 30 years , based on trade agreements of which secretary clinton has voted for almost every one of those . that has got to change . 
webb all right . well , i'm trying to set a mark here so maybe we can get into a little more later on . this hasn't been equal time . but if you want to look at what has happened , if we look at the facts in terms of how we're going to deal with this , since that crash , in the last 10 years , the amount of the world's capital economy that wall street manages has gone from 44 percent to 55 percent . that means the wall street money managers are not risking themselves as the same way the american people are when they're going to get their compensation . they're managing money from all over the world . we have to take that into consideration when we're looking at ways to regulate it . 
o'malley john , john , 
sanders can i can i finish , please ? all right ? and you can there are people who hold that view . and that's fine , if you hold it . i think what you do is you hold those people who have used the gun accountable . you try to make . . . 
clinton he's not wall street . 
o'malley thank you . i believe whether it's a back door or a front door that the american principle of law should still hold that our federal government should have to get a warrant , whether they want to come through the back door or your front door . and i also agree , lester , with benjamin franklin , who said , no people should ever give up their privacy or their freedoms in a promise for security . so we're a collaborative people . we need collaborative leadership here with silicon valley and other bright people in my own state of maryland and around the nsa that can actually figure this out . but there are certain immutable principles that will not become antique things in our country so long as we defend our country and its values and its freedoms . and one of those things is our right to be secure in our homes , and our right to expect that our federal government should have to get a warrant . i also want to the say that while we've made some progress on the patriot act , i do believe that we need an adversarial court system there . we need a public advocate . we need to develop jurisprudence so that we can develop a body of law that protects the privacy of americans in the information and digital age . 
sanders . . . to an approach that works in the middle east . cheering and applause 
sanders well , look . . . 
clinton yes , let's tell the truth , martin . 
sanders that is why we need to make . . . that is why we need to make police and i speak as a former mayor . i was a mayor for eight years , worked very closely with a great police department . and what we did is try to move that department toward community policing , so that the police officers become part of the community and not , as we see , in some cities an oppressive force . we need to make police departments look like the communities they serve in terms of diversity . we need to end minimal sentencing . we need , basically , to pledge that we're going to invest in this country , in jobs and education , not more jails and incarceration . 
clinton and , i want to say i also want to say that i do i do think it is absolutely critical and incredible that we have so many young people involved in the political process . i applaud all of those who are applauding you , senator sanders . we're happy that they are supporting you , that they are passionately committed to you and to the issues . but , let me also say it's going to be important that we unify the democratic party when the nomination process has been completed . . . 
sanders good . you're right . i want to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure , create 13 million jobs . we do that by doing away with the absurd loophole that now allows major profitable corporations to stash their money in the cayman islands , and not in some years , pay a nickel in taxes . yes , i do . i plead guilty . i want every kid in this country who has the ability to be able to go to a public college , or university , tuition free . and , by the way , i want to substantially lower student debt interest rates in this country as well . how do i pay for it ? i pay for it through a tax on wall street speculation . this country , and the middle class , bailed out wall street . now , it is wall street's time to help the middle class . in fact . . . 
sanders that's just not accurate . well . . . 
sanders let me just add to that . just because this is not an esoteric argument . you're seeing cities like seattle . you're seeing cities like san francisco , cities like los angeles doing it , and they are doing it well and workers are able to have more disposable income . 
clinton well because i am a progressive who gets things done . and the root of that word , progressive , is progress . but i've heard senator sanders comments , and it's really caused me to wonder who's left in the progressive wing of the democratic party . under his definition , president obama is not progressive because he took donations from wall street ; vice president biden is not progressive because she supported keystone ; senator shaheen is not progressive because she supports the trade pact . even the late , great senator paul wellstone would not fit this definition because he voted for doma . you know , we have differences and , honestly , i think we should be talk about what we want to do for the country . but if we're going to get into labels , i don't think it was particularly progressive to vote against the brady bill five times . i don't think it was progressive to vote to give gun makers and sellers immunity . i don't think it was progressive to vote against ted kennedy's immigration reform . so we could go back and forth like this , but the fact is most people watching tonight want to know what we've done and what we will do . that's why i am laying out a specific agenda that will make more progress , get more jobs with rising incomes , get us to universal health care coverage , get us to universal pre k , paid family leave and the other elements of what i think will build a strong economy , that will ensure americans keep making progress . that's what i'm offering and that's what i will do as president . 
sanders well , for a start , i would tell the gentleman who's the ceo at verizon to start negotiating with the communication workers of america . and this is this is a perfect example , wolf , of the kind of corporate greed which is destroying the middle class of this country . this gentleman makes 18 million a year in salary . that's his that's his compensation . this gentleman is now negotiating to take away health care benefits of verizon workers , outsource call center jobs to the philippines , and and trying to create a situation where workers will lose their jobs . he is not investing in the way he should in inner cities in america . 
clinton but overall , a lot of the forces at work in the region are ones that we cannot directly influence , but we can . . . 
sanders i think snowden played a very important role in educating the american people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined . 
sanders yes . 
sanders well , inaudible the major issue right now is whether or not we reestablish glass steagall . i led the effort , unfortunately unsuccessfully , against deregulation because i knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks it was not going to be good . the issue now is do we break them ? up do we reestablish glass steagall . and secretary clinton , unfortunately , is on the wrong side . 
o'malley kathie , this was not merely theory in maryland . we actually did it . not only were we the first state in the nation to pass a living wage . we were the first to pass a minimum wage . and the u . s . chamber of commerce , which hardly ever says nice things about democratic governors anywhere , named our state number one for innovation and entrepreneurship . we defended the highest median income in the country . and so , look , the way that a stronger middle class is actually the source of economic growth . and if our middle class makes more money , they spend more money , and our whole economy grows . we did it , and it worked , and nobody headed for the hills or left the state because of it . 
sanders yes , well , roughly . let me say this . as a member of the health education committee that helped write the affordable care act , much of what secretary clinton said about what we have done , among other things , ending the obscenity of this pre existing situation is a step forward . seventeen more million more people have health care . it is a step forward . a step forward . but this is what we also have to say . not only are deductibles rising , 29 million americans still have no health insurance and millions of people can't afford to go to the doctor . major crisis and primary health care . here is the bottom line . why is it that the united states of america today is the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care to all people as a right ? why is it . . . 
clinton i do not think it would come to that . we are already de conflicting air space . we know . . . 
sanders thank you . let's be clear . you're looking at the senator who introduced the most comprehensive climate change legislation in the history of the united states senate . now , i hope that secretary clinton would join me if we are serious about climate change , about imposing a tax on carbon on the fossil fuel industry and making massive investments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy . and by the way , while we are on the subject of energy , i hope you'll join me in ending fracking in the united states of america . crosstalk 
sanders well , let me just very briefly tell you a story . when i was in one of my first years in congress , i went to a meeting downtown in washington , d . c . and i went there with another congressman , an african american congressman . and then we kind of separated during the meeting . and then i saw him out later on . and he was sitting there waiting and i said , well , let's go out and get a cab . how come you didn't go out and get a cab ? he said , no , i don't get cabs in washington , d . c . this was 20 years ago . because he was humiliated by the fact that cabdrivers would go past him because he was black . i couldn't believe , you know , you just sit there and you say , this man did not take a cab 20 years ago in washington , d . c . tell you another story , i was with young people active in the black lives matter movement . a young lady comes up to me and she says , you don't understand what police do in certain black communities . you don't understand the degree to which we are terrorized , and i'm not just talking about the horrible shootings that we have seen , which have got to end and we've got to hold police officers accountable , i'm just talking about every day activities where police officers are bullying people . so to answer your question , i would say , and i think it's similar to what the secretary said , when you're white , you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto . you don't know what it's like to be poor . you don't know what it's like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car . and i believe that as a nation in the year 2016 , we must be firm in making it clear . we will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system . 
sanders excuse me . may i have a chance to respond to this issue ? 
clinton well , andrea , i am absolutely committed to universal health care . i have worked on this for a long time , people may remember that i took on the health insurance industry back in the '90s , and i didn't quit until we got the children's health insurance program that ensures eight million kids . and i certainly respect senator sanders' intentions , but when you're talking about health care , the details really matter . and therefore , we have been raising questions about the nine bills that he introduced over 20 years , as to how they would work and what would be the impact on people's health care ? he didn't like that , his campaign didn't like it either . and tonight , he's come out with a new health care plan . and again , we need to get into the details . but here's what i believe , the democratic party and the united states worked since harry truman to get the affordable care act passed . we finally have a path to universal health care . we have accomplished so much already . i do not to want see the republicans repeal it , and i don't to want see us start over again with a contentious debate . i want us to defend and build on the affordable care act and improve it . 
clinton . . . you know , i have spoken about and written at some length the very candid conversations i've had with him and other israeli leaders . nobody is saying that any individual leader is always right , but it is a difficult position . if you are from whatever perspective trying to seek peace , trying to create the conditions for peace when there is a terrorist group embedded in gaza that does not want to see you exist , that is a very difficult challenge . 
o'malley john , i think the i think the call of your question is how can we improve both public safety in america and race relations in america , understanding how very intertwined both of those issues are in a very , very difficult and painful way for us as a people . look , the truth of the matter is that we should all feel a sense of responsibility as americans to look for the things that actually work to save and redeem lives , and to do more of them , and to stop doing the things that don't . for my part , that's what i have done in 15 years of experience as a mayor and as a governor . we restored voting rights to 52 , 000 people . we decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana . i repealed the death penalty . and we also put in place a civilian review board . we reported openly discourtesy , and lethal force and brutality complaints . this is something that and i put forward a new agenda for criminal justice reform that is informed by that experience . so as president , i would lead these efforts , and i would do so with more experience and probably the attendance at more grave sites than any of the three of us on this stage when it comes to urban crime , loss of lives . and the truth is i have learned on a very daily basis that , yes , indeed , black lives matter . 
sanders this is one of the great tragedies in our country today . and we can no longer continue to sweep it under the rug . it has to be dealt with . today a male african american baby born today stands a one in four chance of ending up in jail . that is beyond unspeakable . so what we have to do is the radical reform of a broken criminal justice system . what we have to do is end over policing in african american neighborhoods . the reality is that both the african american community and the white community do marijuana at about equal rates . the reality is four times as many blacks get arrested for marijuana . truth is that far more blacks get stopped for traffic violations . the truth is that sentencing for blacks is higher than for whites . we need fundamental police reform , clearly , clearly , when we talk about a criminal justice system . i would hope that we could all agree that we are sick and tired of seeing videos on television of unarmed people , often african americans , shot by police officers . what we have got to do is make it clear that any police officer who breaks the law will , in fact , be held accountable . 
o'malley all right , nancy , i really wish you'd come back to me on this on this one , john . . . 
clinton . . . and go after isis , which i don't think would be a good idea . 
clinton and i have said and i will say again , i will be happy to release anything i have as long as everybody else does too , because what really is behind that question , republicans and democrats , is where i can stand up to wall street . well , let's have some facts instead of some rhetoric for a change . i went to wall street when i was a united states senator . i told them they were wrecking the economy . i asked for a moratorium on foreclosures . i asked that we do more to try to prevent what i worried was going to happen . i also called for closing loopholes including the carried interest loophole . i also called for changes in ceo pay . i have a record . and you know what , if you were going to be in some way distrusted or dismissed about whether you can take on wall street if you ever took money , president obama took more money from wall street in the 2008 campaign than anybody ever had . and when it came time to stand up to wall street , he passed and signed the toughest regulation since the great depression with the dodd frank regulations . 
clinton well , i think we are in vigorous agreement on this . i have said repeatedly no bank is too big to fail , no executive too powerful to jail . and i have said that i would use the tools in the dodd frank regulations , that if any bank posed a systemic risk to the economy , they would be broken up . because we now have tools , laws that we didn't have before . and i am very happy we did . because there does need to be accountability , including criminal accountability if it is called for . 
chafee i'd just arrived at the senate . i think we'd get some takeovers , and that was one . it was my very first vote , and it was 92 5 . it was the . . . 
sanders let me just say that you might want to ask the governor of the state of vermont why he could not do it . i'm not the governor . i'm the senator from the state of vermont . laughter but second of all second of all . . . . . . here is what the real point is , in terms of all of the issues you've raised the good questions you've raised . you know what it all comes down to ? do you know why we can't do what every other country major country on earth is doing ? it's because we have a campaign finance system that is corrupt , we have super pacs , we have the pharmaceutical industry pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into campaign contributions and lobbying , and the private insurance companies as well . what this is really about is not the rational way to go forward it's medicare for all it is whether we have the guts to stand up to the private insurance companies and all of their money , and the pharmaceutical industry . that's what this debate should be about . 
clinton . . . and they're held responsible . 
sanders well , let me make a couple of responses . let me pick up on the last point the secretary made . you know , we are , if elected president , going to invest a lot of money into mental health . and when you watch these republican debates , you know why we need to invest in that . laughter and applause but here's the difference . here is the difference . it's not a personal difference . we just do things differently . all right . i honestly look , we have a corrupt campaign finance system . and what secretary clinton is saying and what every candidate who receives from the fossil fuel industry or the drug companies or wall street say , not going to impact me . the question the american people have to ask is , why are these people putting millions of dollars into candidates if it's not going to make a difference ? 
clinton . . . or combination of ways . . . booing . . . you know . . . booing . . . it it's all it's always a little bit , uh , challenging because , you know , if senator sanders doesn't agree with how you are approaching something , then you are a member of the establishment . well , let me say then . . . 
clinton . . . respectfully addlook , we did differ . a vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat isis . we have to look at the threats that we face right now . . . . . . and we have to be prepared to take them on and defeat them . 
clinton if i could , let me just say that of course it has to change . it has to change . and that's why i have put forward a plan to do just that . and it's been judged to be the toughest , most effective and comprehensive one . i have great respect for senator sanders's commitment to try to restore glass steagall . but i do not believe that that is enough . and in fact , i don't believe it really addresses a lot of the biggest issues we have . you know , we now have power under the dodd frank legislation to break up banks . and i've said i will use that power if they pose a systemic risk . but i want to go further , because it was investment banks , it was insurance companies , it was mortgage companies , all of which contributed . so let's not just be narrowly focused on one part of the problem . we have a lot of issues with corporate power that have to be addressed . my plan takes us further and it would do the job . crosstalk 
sanders can i answer . . . 
webb thank you . i've been standing over here for about ten minutes , trying . 
sanders the point is we have got to break them up so that they do not pose a systemic risk and so that we have a vibrant economy with a competitive financial system . 
sanders but chuck , it is a public financing system that everybody knows is antiquated . it no longer works . nobody can become president based on that system . so what's the alternative ? there are two alternatives . and , you know , we looked at it . well , should we do a super pac , but i concluded , honestly , i don't represent corporate america or billionaires , i didn't want it . so the other alternative was to ask working families and the middle class to help out in a transformational campaign . and you know what ? we got 3 . 5 million individual contributions , 27 a piece . i think that's pretty good . 
sanders it's a country in which people choose to buy guns . i think half of the more than half of the people in my own state of vermont , my guess here in new hampshire , are gun owners . that's the right of people . but this is what i do believe . i believe that when we have some 300 million guns in this country , i believe that when we have seen these horrific mass killings , not only in san bernardino , but in colorado and movie theaters in colorado , i think we have got to bring together the vast majority of the people who do in fact believe in sensible gun safety regulations . for example , talking about polls , a poll recently came out , overwhelming majority of the american people say we should strengthen the instant background check . who denies that it is crazy . . . who denies that it is crazy to allow people to own guns who are criminals or are mentally unstable ? we've got to eliminate the gun show loophole . in my view , we have got to see that weapons designed by the military to kill people are not in the hands of civilians . i think there is a consensus . i think i'm not going to say that everybody is in agreement . it's a divided country on guns . but there is a broad consensus on sensible gun safety regulations that i , coming from a state that has virtually no gun control , will do my best to bring together . 
sanders well , it ain't henry kissinger . that's for sure . 
webb i wouldn't have a problem with that . let me start by saying my wife is an immigrant . she was a refugee , her family escaped from vietnam on a boat her entire extended family , after the communists took over , when hundreds of thousands of people were out there and thousands of them were dying . went to two refugee camps , she never spoke english in her home , and she ended , as i said , graduating from cornell law school . that's not only american dream , that's a value that we have with a good immigration system in place . no country has is a country without defining its borders . we need to resolve this issue . i actually introduced an amendment in the 2007 immigration bill . . . 
sanders good evening . i am running for president of the united states because it is too late for establishment politics and establishment economics . i'm running for president because our economy is rigged because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and almost all of new wealth and income being created is going to the top one percent . i'm running for president because i'm going to create an economy that works for working families not just billionaires . i'm running for president because we have a campaign finance system which is corrupt , where billionaires are spending hundreds of millionaires of dollars to buy candidates who will represent their interests rather than the middle class and working families . i'm running because we need to address the planetary crisis of climate change and take on the fossil fuel industry and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy . i'm running for president because i want a new foreign policy ; one that takes on isis , one that destroys isis , but one that does not get us involved in perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the middle east but rather works around a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting muslim troops on the ground . that's the kind of coalition we need and that's the kind of coalition i will put together . 
clinton well , john , i come from the '60s , a long time ago . there was a lot of activism on campus civil rights activism , antiwar activism , women's rights activism and i do appreciate the way young people are standing up and speaking out . obviously , i believe that on a college campus , there should be enough respect so people hear each other . but what happened at the university there , what's happening at other universities , i think reflects the deep sense of , you know , concern , even despair that so many young people , particularly of color , have . . . you know , i recently met with a group of mothers who lost their children to either killings by police or random killings in their neighborhoods , and hearing their stories was so incredibly , profoundly heartbreaking . each one of them , you know , described their child , had a picture . you know , the mother of the young man with his friends in the car who was playing loud music and , you know , some older white man pulled out a gun and shot him because they wouldn't turn the radio down . or a young woman who had been performing at president obama's second inauguration coming home , absolutely stellar young woman , hanging out with her friends in a park getting shot by a gang member . and , of course , i met the mothers of eric garner and tamir rice , and michael brown and trayvon martin and so many of them who have lost their children . so , your original question is the right question . and it's not just a question for parents and grandparents to answer . it's really a question for all of us to answer , every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her god given potential . and that's what we need to be doing to the best of our ability in our country . 
sanders of course the united states must lead . but the united states is not the policeman of the world . the united states must not be involved in perpetual warfare in the middle east . the united states , at the same time , cannot successfully fight assad and isis . isis , now , is the major priority . let's get rid of assad later . let's have a democratic syria . but the first task is to bring countries together to destroy isis . 
o'malley oh , come on . 
o'malley yes , lester , year in and year out i was the leader of the u . s . . . . 
sanders well , i agree with the des moines register , but let's not blow this out of proportion . this is not athis is not , like , a winner take all thing . i think where we now standcorrect me if i'm wrongyou have 22 delegates , i have 20 delegates . we need 2 , 500 delegates to win the nomination . laughter you know , so this is notthis is not the biggest deal in the world . we think , by the way , based on talking to our precinct captains , we may have at least two more delegates . what the des moines register saidyou know , there were coini think there were half a dozen coin flipsa fairly chaotic type situation . at the end of the day , no matter how it's recounted , it will break roughly even . and by the way , i love and respect the caucus process in iowa . see , and i don't have to say it , because they voted already . laughter and i love new hampshire , too , because you haven't voted , but . . . . . . but , look , i think people are blowing this up out of proportion . but i think we need improvements in the process by which results are determined . 
clinton well , actually , i have been very consistent . over the course of my entire life , i have always fought for the same values and principles , but , like most human beings including those of us who run for office i do absorb new information . i do look at what's happening in the world . you know , take the trade deal . i did say , when i was secretary of state , three years ago , that i hoped it would be the gold standard . it was just finally negotiated last week , and in looking at it , it didn't meet my standards . my standards for more new , good jobs for americans , for raising wages for americans . and i want to make sure that i can look into the eyes of any middle class american and say , this will help raise your wages . and i concluded i could not . 
sanders it was 99 to one and i was maybe the one . i don't know . 
huckabee now , everybody else has fudged their time and gone over , so please , don't cut me off too quick , becky . 
trump first of all , i have to say , as a businessman , i get along with everybody . i have business all over the world . booing i know so many of the people in the audience . and by the way , i'm a self funder . i don't have i have my wife and i have my son . that's all i have . i don't have this . so let me just tell you , i get along with everybody , which is my obligation to my company , to myself , et cetera . obviously , the war in iraq was a big , fat mistake . all right ? now , you can take it any way you want , and it took it took jeb bush , if you remember at the beginning of his announcement , when he announced for president , it took him five days . he went back , it was a mistake , it wasn't a mistake . it took him five days before his people told him what to say , and he ultimately said , it was a mistake . the war in iraq , we spent 2 trillion , thousands of lives , we don't even have it . iran has taken over iraq , with the second largest oil reserves in the world . obviously , it was a mistake . 
cruz hold on . he he attacked me , wolf . i get a response . 
trump what i've seen up here i mean , first of all , this guy is a choke artist , and this guy is a liar . you have a combination . . . 
paul there is an argument that china doesn't like the deal , because in us doing the deal , we'll be trading with their competitors . you're exactly right . but i think we've sort of missed the point a little bit here . there is an important point , though , about how we discuss these trade treaties that i do agree with mr . trump on . we should negotiate from a position of strength . and we also should negotiate using the full force and the constitutional power that was given to us . i think it's a mistake that we give up power to the presidency on these trade deals . we give up the power to filibuster , and i'm kind of fond of that power . laughter we give up the power to amend . and i think , really , one of the big problems we have in our country is , over the last century , really , so much power has gravitated to the executive branch . really , congress is kind of a bystander . we don't write the rules . we don't make the laws . the executive branch does . so even in trade and i am for trade i think we should be careful about giving so much power to the presidency . 
christie and senator paul knows that that's simply not the truth . in new jersey , we have medical marijuana laws , which i supported and implemented . this is not medical marijuana . there's goes as much a further step beyond . this is recreational use of marijuana . this is much different . and so , while he would like to use a sympathetic story to back up his point , it doesn't work . i'm not against medical marijuana . we do it in new jersey . but i'm against the recreational use against marijuana . if he wants to change the federal law , get congress to pass the law to change it , and get a president to sign it . 
rubio well , i'm sorry i didn't answer that part . so the thing is that my my generation , someone my age would retire at 68 . we would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70 . and so my children would retire at 70 . i would retire at 68 . it would be a graduating scale over a period of time . but again i'm talking about people like myself and ted who are 45 years old . we're years away from retirement . for people that are on it now , we don't have to change it at all . if we don't do anything , we will have a debt crisis . it's not a question of if . it is a question of when . in less than five years , only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary ; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on medicare , medicaid , the interest on the debt . that's all of it will be eaten up by that . that's a debt crisis . and it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis . 
trump oh , yeah . 
rubio well , first of all , i think amnesty is the forgiveness of a wrongdoing without consequence and that i've never supported that . i do not support that . i think there has to be consequences for violating our immigration laws . what i think is clear about this issue to begin with is we're not going to be able to make progress on illegal immigration until first , illegal immigration is brought under control . you go back to 1986 , when they legalized three million people and they promised to secure the border . it didn't happen , and as a result , people have lost trust in the federal government . it is now clear that the only way to make progress on immigration is not just to pass a law that enforces the law , but actually prove to people that it's working . they want to see the wall built . they want to see the additional border agents . they want to see e verify . they want to see an entry exit tracking system . forty percent of the people in this country illegally are entering legally and overstaying visas . and only after all of that is in place , then we'll see what the american people are willing to support on this issue . i think the american people will be very reasonable , but responsible , about how you handle someone who has been here a long time , who can pass a background check , who pays a fine and starts paying taxes and all they want is a work permit . but you can't do any of that until you prove to people that illegal immigration is under control once and for all . 
trump well , i think it's very unprofessional . 
christie it gets very unruly when he gets off his talking points . 
cruz but maria , radical islamic terrorism was not invented 24 months ago ; 24 months ago , we had al qaida . we had boko haram . we had hamas . we had hezbollah . we had iran putting operatives in south america and central america . it's the reason why i stood with jeff sessions and steve king and led the fight to stop the gang of eight amnesty bill , because it was clear then , like it's clear now , that border security is national security . 
cruz donald , you could resolve this issue very quickly by simply . . . audience booing . . . releasing the new york times tape . because , listen , maybe it's right . 
cruz . . . why would you then bail out rich wall street banks , but not main street , not mom and pop , not sabina loving ? 
rubio no , in fact what i have said is the only thing the fbi made this very clear 48 hours ago the only thing they are asking of apple is that apple allow them to use their own systems in the fbi to try to guess the password of the san bernardino killer . apple initially came out saying , we're being ordered to create a back door to an encryption device . that is not accurate . the only thing they're being asked to do , and the fbi made this very clear about 48 hours ago , is allow us to disable the self destruct mode that's in the apple phone so that we can try to guess using our own systems what the password of this killer was . and i think they should comply with that . if that's all they're asking for , they are not asking for apple to create a back door to encryption . 
christie well , what it would like is , we have one of the great advantages of america being the open society that we are . it is , we are not hiding things from the american people , but china everyday is conducting business in a way that hides things from their people . so if they want to come in and attack all the personnel records in the federal government , which they've done , and which they now have my social security number and my fingerprints , as well as maybe some other folks' who are on this stage . the fact is , they need to be fought back on . and what we need to do is go at the things that they are most sensitive and most embarrassing to them ; that they're hiding ; get that information and put it out in public . let the chinese people start to digest how corrupt the chinese government is ; how they steal from the chinese people ; and how they're enriching oligarchs all throughout china . they need to understand that . and we need to take those type of steps . this president has seen personnel records of people who have sacrificed for the american people and for the federal government stolen by the chinese and he's done nothing in return . this is why this is what i said at the beginning that this administration , barack obama and hillary clinton through their foreign policy , have betrayed the american people , because the weakness they've displayed has led to putin's incursions in the middle east and in eastern europe , and has led has led to significant problems in the middle east as well , and the death and murder of lots of folks . 
trump thank you . 
fiorina you see , governor christie , people spend time talking about their track records , and mr . trump and i have every right to do the same . and mrs . clinton has to defend her track record . her track record of lying about benghazi , of lying about her e mails , about lying about her servers . she does not have a track record of accomplishment . like mrs . clinton , i , too , have travels hundreds of thousands of miles around the globe . but unlike mrs . clinton , i know flying is an activity , not an accomplishment . mrs . clinton if you want to stump a democrat , ask them to name a accomplishment of mrs . clinton's . 
cruz you know , every candidate running for president says they will stand up to washington . the natural follow up question is when have you ever stood up to washington . last week we saw a powerful illustration of that . i campaigned in the state of iowa four square against the ethanol mandate , something everyone said was political suicide . my two leading competitors both attacked me for it . the governor of the state said vote for anyone but cruz , and lobbyists spent millions of dollars in attack ads , but i stood and said we should have no mandates , a level playing field , and the people of iowa put country and our children above the cronyism and corporate welfare . . . bell rings . . . we can turn this country around if we get back to the constitution . and , i will always stand with the american people against the bipartisan corruption of washington . 
cruz so that means on supreme court . . . 
rubio he hired workers from poland . and he had to pay a million dollars or so in a judgment from . . . 
kasich can i . . . 
huckabee john , listen , let's keep in mind that for one third of the 60 million americans on social security it represents 90 percent of their income . and , when i hear people talking about means testing , let's just remember what that means . if we means test social security , it means that the government decides whether or not i deserve it . if a person lives in a seven room house , does the government get to say you don't need seven rooms , we're going to take two of them away ? folks , the government has no business stealing even more from the people who have paid this in . i just want to remind you , people paid their money . they expect to have it . and , if this government doesn't pay it , than tell me what's different between the government and bernie madolf , who sits in prison today for doing less than what the government has done to the people on social security and medicare in this country . 
rubio sure , because bankruptcy doesn't work unless you change the way you're operating , or you're going to be bankrupt again . and , the problem with puerto rico is it's economy is not growing . it has a massive exodus of professionals and others that are leaving to my home state of florida , and all over the country . they're coming to the mainland from puerto rico because the economy there is not growing , it's too expensive to do business there . the tax rate is too high . the government regulations are too extensive . this year alone , with all the problems they're having , they barely cut their budget from one year to the next . so , i think the leadership on the island has to show their willingness to get their house in order and put in place measures allow the economy there to grow again . if the economy of puerto rico does not grow they will never generate the revenue to pay this debt , or the billions of dollars in unfunded liabilities that they have on their books of promises they've made to future generations to make payments . so , yes , if they do all of those things then we can explore the use of bankruptcy protection , but not as the first resort , which is what they're asking for , because it will not solve the problems on the island and you're going to continue to see hundreds of thousands of people leave that beautiful place , and coming to the mainland . they're united states citizens , they're obviously entitled to do so , and we welcome them , but we would also prefer to see a puerto rico that once again is growing economically , and is robust . and , the leaders in charge there now are doing a terrible job . their previous governor , louis fortuno was doing a great job until he barely lost that election to . . . bell ringing . . . to someone who has taken a big government stance once again . . . 
cruz well , the abuse of the h1 b program has been rampant . on the face of that h1 b abuse , i have proposed , and promised as president that i will impose a 180 day moratorium on the h1b program to implement a comprehensive investigation and audit because you got u . s . companies that are firing american workers , bringing in foreign workers , and forcing them to train their replacements . and , i would note that is not dissimilar to what we discovered at the last debate concerning the hotel that donald owns down in florida . down in florida that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers , and afterwards it was really striking . i watched the cnn interview donald did where he explained , he said , well the problem is you can't find americans who are qualified , or who want to work as waiters and waitresses . now , let me ask the people here , how many people have worked as a waiter or waitress ? millions across this country . that is an astonishing statement . you know , marco's dad started as a bartender . my dad started washing dishes , and yet , you know how many americans wanted those jobs ? bell ringing roughly 300 applied , donald hired 17 . and , that's why this new york times tape is so troubling because what's been reported is that donald told the editorial board of the new york times what i'm saying on immigration , i don't believe . i'm not going to build a wall , i'm not going to deport people , this is all just rhetoric for the voters . now , if he didn't say that , he has an easy solution . simply release the tape . but , for everyone at home who's mad at politicians that lied to us , donald's record right now as he standing here . . . 
bush you could , if you were serious about . . . 
rubio well , thank you for having us tonight . you know , this campaign has come a long way . it was just a few months ago there were 15 or 11 us on the stage and now it's narrowed and the votes are starting to count . and we have an incredible decision to make , not just about the direction of america , but the identity of our party and of the conservative movement . the time for games is over . i know you've had a lot of choices to make , but now it's time to narrow it down . and i'm asking you to get behind me , go on our web site and join you our effort , marcorubio . com , so we can bring an end to this silliness , this looniness , and once again re embrace all the things that made america and the republican party the bearer of the conservative movement in this country . 
kasich bret , it's very interesting to note , i think it's for the good of the record here that they took a survey of foreign policy magazines , 700 foreign policy experts , who would be the best person to conduct foreign policy of all the candidates in the race ? i received 55 percent of the vote . jeb bush received 30 percent of the vote . and everybody else , none of them made double digits . and that's because you have to have the experience . and you know , we hear about ronald reagan rebuilding the military . i was there when ronald reagan rebuilt the military . i worked with him . i was there when ronald reagan rebuilt the economy . i was there , and i worked with him . i knew ronald reagan . and i'll leave it right there with what comes after that . you can figure that one out . 
kasich . . . the reason it happens . . . 
carson what i agree with is that we need a significantly changed taxation system . and the one that i've advocated is based on tithing , because i think god is a pretty fair guy . and he said , you know , if you give me a tithe , it doesn't matter how much you made . if you've had a bumper crop , you don't owe me triple tithes . and if you've had no crops at all , you don't owe me no tithes . so there must be something inherently fair about that . and that's why i've advocated a proportional tax system . you make 10 billion , you pay a billion . you make 10 , you pay one . and everybody gets treated the same way . and you get rid of the deductions , you get rid of all the loopholes , and . . . timer sounds 
trump well , i think the thing about the flat tax , i know it very well . what i don't like is that if you make 200 million a year , you pay ten percent , you're paying very little relatively to somebody that's making 50 , 000 a year , and has to hire hr block to do the because it's so complicated . one thing i'll say to ben is that we've had a graduated tax system for many years , so it's not a socialistic thing . what i'd like to do , and i'll be putting in the plan in about two weeks , and i think people are going to like it , it's a major reduction in taxes . it's a major reduction for the middle class . the hedge fund guys won't like me as much as they like me right now . i know them all , but they'll pay more . i know people that are making a tremendous amount of money and paying virtually no tax , and i think it's unfair . 
rubio trump steaks is gone . you have ruined these companies . 
trump speaking for myself , i'm ok with it . i think there's a certain truth to it . i know people that , frankly , it has no impact on their life whatsoever . there are many people . i would almost say leave it up to them , but i would be willing to check it off , and say i will not get social security . i do not . . . 
trump tapes were not on the subject , but that's . . . 
christie yeah , david , i would just like you to listen , again , everybody . this is the difference between being a governor who actually has to be responsible for problems and not answering a question . the question was , did he fight for his legislation ? it's abundantly clear that he didn't . it's abundantly clear that he didn't fight for the legislation . when the teachers unions attacked me with 20 million of ads because i wanted to reform teacher tenure , i fought them and fought them and fought them and i won . when they didn't want when people wanted to raise taxes in my state at democratic legislature and threatened to close down the government , i told them , fine . close down the government . i'll get in my cars , head to the governor's mansion , order a pizza , open a beer and watch the mets . you can call me when the government reopens . and guess what they didn't do ? they didn't pass a tax increase , because i vetoed it and they never closed the government because they knew i would fight for what i believed in . the fact of the matter is , a leader must fight for what they believe in . not handicap it and say , well maybe since i can't win this one , i'll run . that's not what leadership is . bell rings that's what congress is . 
rubio i had something important . 
carson well , you know , i was a radical democrat before i started listening to ronald reagan . and he didn't sound like what they said republicans were . he sounded logical . and i hope that i sound logical also . because when i look at what is going on with the united states of america , i see a lot of things that are not logical . i see us allowing people to divide us , when in fact our strength is in our unity . i see people exercising the most irresponsible fiscal habits that anyone could possibly do . and hiding it from the american people , so that the majority of people have no idea what our financial situation is . so , when someone comes along and says , free college , free phones , free this and that , and the other , they say , wow , that's nice , having no idea that they're destabilizing our position . and i think also that ronald reagan was a master at understanding that a pinnacle nation has to be a nation that leads . if we learn to lead in the middle east right now , a coalition will form behind us , but never they do it if we just sit there and talk about it . real leadership is what i would hopefully bring to america . 
rubio no . no . what i said was that i think that dr . carson's ideas are good ideas . they're not my ideas , and i don't necessarily agree with all of them . but this is what you're seeing in the republican debate that you didn't see in that democrat debate . you didn't see it for a minute . you didn't see these kind of ideas being batted around , and being batted around in a way that's civil and smart and that's trying to help to inform the voter out there . what you saw was a parade of , i'll give you this for free ; i'll give you that for free . let me tell you , everybody , when they say they want to give it to you for free , keep your hands on your wallets because they're coming to you to pay for it . and that's why i think these ideas up here are great , and that's what we should have is have more discussions like this and less gotcha . crosstalk 
cruz let me tell you how that question . . . crosstalk 
trump no , i and you know why ? you know why ? 
rubio notice that's not an answer . 
kasich . . . this is a giant battle in the world today . . . 
cruz justice scalia was a legal giant . he was somebody that i knew for 20 years . he was a brilliant man . he was faithful to the constitution . he changed the arc of american legal history . and i'll tell you , his passing tonight , our prayers are with his family , with his wife , maureen , who he adored , his nine children , his 36 grandkids . but it underscores the stakes of this election . we are one justice away from a supreme court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states . we are one justice away from a supreme court that will reverse the heller decision , one of justice scalia's seminal decisions , that upheld the second amendment right to keep and to bear arms . we are one justice away from a supreme court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of americans and the stakes of this election , for this year , for the senate , the senate needs to stand strong and say , we're not going to give up the u . s . supreme court for a generation by allowing barack obama to make one more liberal appointee . and then for the state of south carolina , one of the most important judgments for the men and women of south carolina to make is who on this stage has the background , the principle , the character , the judgment and the strength of resolve to nominate and confirm principled constitutionalists to the court ? that will be what i will do if i'm elected president . 
rubio because they currently occupy sunni cities and villages . sunni cities and villages can only truly be liberated and held by sunnis themselves . if they are held by shias it will trigger sectarian violence . the kurds are incredible fighters and they will liberate the kurdish areas , but kurds can not and do not want to liberate and hold sunni villages and towns . it will take sunni fighters themselves in that region to take those villages and cities , and then to hold them and avoid the sort of sectarian violence that follows in the past . and why that is important is because if sunnis are not able to govern themselves in these areas , you are going to have a successor group to isis . isis is a successor group of al qaida . in fact , they broke away . . . bell rings . . . from al qaida , because as horrible as al qaida is , isis thought al qaida was not radical enough . this is who we're dealing with , and they have more money than al qaida ever had . 
carson can i say something . . . 
rubio . . . if you're our nominee , we will lose . . . 
trump that's a lot of lies . 
christie and you know you know , senator paul ? senator paul , you know , the hugs that i remember are the hugs that i gave to the families who lost their people on september 11th . those are the hugs i remember , and those had nothing to do and those had nothing to do with politics , unlike what you're doing by cutting speeches on the floor of the senate , then putting them on the internet within half an hour to raise money for your campaign . . . 
bush yes you did . 
huckabee it's not too big to shrink . but the problem is we have a wall street to washington axis of power that has controlled the political climate . the donor class feeds the political class who does the dance that the donor class wants . and the result is federal government keeps getting bigger . every person on this stage who has been a governor will tell that you the biggest fight they had was not the other party . wasn't even the legislature . it was the federal government , who continually put mandates on the states that we had to suck up and pay for . and the fact is there are a lot of things happening at the federal level that are absolutely beyond the jurisdiction of the constitution . this is power that should be shifted back to the states , whether it's the epa , there is no role at the federal level for the department of education . cheering and applause and i'm still one who says that we can get rid of the internal revenue service if we would pass the fairtax , which is a tax on consumption rather than a tax on people's income , and move power back where the founders believed it should have been all along . 
bush because i first of all , i know what i don't know . i know what i don't know . i would seek out , as i have , the best advice that exists . i won't get my information from the shows . i don't know if that's saturday morning or sunday morning . i don't know which one . laughter i will seek out the best advice , and i will create a strategy and i will persuade the american people what the role of america should be . i've laid out a policy of rebuilding our military . all of the talk that we're seeing here most of which i agree on , frankly requires a much stronger military . we now have a lack of readiness that is quite scary . we have planes that were that harry truman inaugurated , the b 52 . we have the navy has been gutted and decimated . the readiness of the marines is way down . if we're serious about america's leadership in the world , then we need to make sure that we have the back of the armed forces . the armed forces radio is here listening to this today . i hope they know that if i'm president , i'll be a commander in chief , not an agitator in chief or a divider in chief , that i will lead this country in a way that will create greater security and greater safety . 
trump again , i think i gave them both checks to be exactly honest . i think they both liked me very much . but the fact is that . . . 
trump shocking . laughter 
trump i totally disavow the klu klux klan . i totally disavow david duke . i've been doing it now for two weeks , this is your you're probably about the 18th person that's asked me the question . it was very clear , that question was also talked about in the form of groups . groups , i want to know which groups are you talking about ? you have to tell me which groups ? ultimately , he got to the klu klux klan , which obviously i'm going to disavow . and , by the way , if you look on my twitter account , almost immediately after the program they were disavowed again . you know , it's amazing . when i do something on twitter , everybody picks it up , goes all over the place . but , when i did this one nobody ever picks it up . take a look at my twitter account . 
rubio this is a republican debate , right ? because that attack about letting people die in the streets . . . 
kasich well , thank you . you know , i look in the faces of people all across this country , and i know they want to be hopeful . and many are hopeful . look , i can take conservative policies to the white house , to washington , to restore the strength of our economy . but i also want to transfer power , money and influence to where you live , because i believe the strength in this country rests in the neighborhoods , the families , the communities and our states . and i believe it's a new partnership a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of america and strengthen america for the best century we've ever had . thank you . 
fiorina . . . aren't dying waiting for health care . 
cruz ? . . . jake . . . 
rubio well , they most certainly will have to be worked on to provide more than what they are doing now . there's no doubt about it . and there's one one major reason why they have not been willing to be a broader part of the coalition , and that is they have lost complete trust and confidence in this president . this president cut a deal with their moral enemy , the shia , in iran . and this is the reason why they no longer trust this president and are willing to work alongside them . but they have as much invested in this as we do . in fact , more so , for it is the king of saudi arabia they want to behead first . it's the king of jordan that they want to dethrone . it's the they want to go into egypt the way they've already gone into libya . and on another point that we need to talk about , assad is one of the main reasons why isis even exists to begin with . assad is a puppet of iran . and he has been so brutal toward the sunni within syria that he created the space that led to the people of syria themselves to stand up and try to overthrow him . that led to the chaos which allowed isis to come in and take advantage of that situation and grow more powerful . and the fact that this president led from behind meant there were no alternative groups on the ground to be empowered , leaving isis with the prime operating space they needed to become the force they have now become . crosstalk 
trump if i ask them , if i need them , you know , most of the people on this stage i've given to , just so you understand , a lot of money . 
cruz wolf , i believe in a america first foreign policy , that far too often president obama and hillary clinton and , unfortunately , more than a few republicans have gotten distracted from the central focus of keeping this country safe . so let's go back to the beginning of the obama administration , when hillary clinton and barack obama led nato in toppling the government in libya . they did it because they wanted to promote democracy . a number of republicans supported them . the result of that and we were told then that there were these moderate rebels that would take over . well , the result is , libya is now a terrorist war zone run by jihadists . move over to egypt . once again , the obama administration , encouraged by republicans , toppled mubarak who had been a reliable ally of the united states , of israel , and in its place , morsi and the muslim brotherhood came in , a terrorist organization . and we need to learn from history . these same leaders obama , clinton , and far too many republicans want to topple assad . assad is a bad man . gadhafi was a bad man . mubarak had a terrible human rights record . but they were assisting us at least gadhafi and mubarak in fighting radical islamic terrorists . and if we topple assad , the result will be isis will take over syria , and it will worsen u . s . national security interests . and the approach , instead of being a woodrow wilson democracy promoter . . . 
trump i'm donald trump . i wrote the art of the deal . i say not in a braggadocious way , i've made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all over the world , and i want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals , we make our country rich again , we make it great again . we build our military , we take care of our vets , we get rid of obamacare , and we have a great life altogether . thank you . thank you . 
rubio later that year , in 2004 , john kerry ran for president missing close to 60 to 70 percent of his votes . i don't recall the sun in fact , the sun sentinel endorsed him . in 2008 , barack obama missed 60 or 70 percent of his votes , and the same newspaper endorsed him again . so this is another example of the double standard that exists in this country between the mainstream media and the conservative movement . 
trump oh , i know . you're a tough guy , jeb . i know . 
bush well , first of all , it's interesting that that happened literally days when this hostage release took place in iran . a day or two days afterwards , north korea took a held an american student hostage . i think it's when we send a signal of weakness , when we are negotiating to release people that committed crimes in our country for people that didn't commit crimes that are held hostage in iran . we saw the shameful treatment of our sailors , that this creates weakness sends a signal of weakness around the world . the next president of the united states is going to have to get back in the game . where the united states' word matters . where we back up our allies , where we don't send signals of weakness . we need to use every every influence possible to get this student back . and i think john is right about this , there are crippling sanctions that are available , as it relates to the two or three banks that north korea uses to to use it illicit trade . we ought to re establish sanctions , not just because of the student , but because of their actions that they're taking right now , as it relates to building this missile capability . 
trump excuse me . 
walker people are upset with washington . 
trump excuse me , am i allowed to finish ? 
fiorina i wouldn't change the 10 bill , or the 20 bill . i think , honestly , it's a gesture . i don't think it helps to change our history . what i would think is that we ought to recognize that women are not a special interest group . women are the majority of this nation . we are half the potential of this nation , and this nation will be better off when every woman has the opportunity to live the life she chooses . 
rubio ok , good , then i'll get to it inaudible . here's the . . . 
cruz well , jake , you know , i'm i'm very glad that donald trump's being in this race has forced the mainstream media finally to talk about illegal immigration . i think that's very important . i like and respect ben carson . i'll let him talk about his own plans . but i will say this the natural next question that primary voters are asking , after we focus on illegal immigration is , okay , what are the records of the various candidates ? and this is an issue on which there are stark differences . a majority of the men and women on this stage have previously and publicly embraced amnesty . i am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty and , in fact , who helped lead the fight to stop a massive amnesty plan . in 2013 , when barack obama and harry reid joined the washington republicans in a massive , i stood shoulder to shoulder with jeff sessions helping lead the fight . you know , folks here have talked about , how do you secure the borders ? well , i've been leading the fight in the senate to triple the border patrol , to put in place fencings and walls , to put in place a strong biometric exit entry system . . . 
cruz well , number one , we need to see responsibility . social security right now is careening towards insolvency , and it's irresponsible . and any politician that doesn't step forward and address it is not being a real leader . we need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen social security . and as president , what i will do for seniors , for anyone at or near retirement , there will be no changes whatsoever . every benefit will be protected to the letter . but for younger workers , we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation . and as you noted dinan , we need to have for younger workers , that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts , like the 401 k , that you own , that you control , that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids . and one of the things that is critically important . listen , we've got lots of challenges in the world . but the answer can't just be wave a magic wand and say problem go away . you have to understand the problems . you have to have real solutions . it's like government spending . it is very easy . hillary clinton says she'll cut waste , fraud and abuse . if only we had smarter people in washington , that would fix the problem . you know what ? that is the statement of a liberal who doesn't understand government is the problem . here's my philosophy . the less government , the more freedom . the fewer bureaucrats , the more prosperity . and there are bureaucrats in . . . bell rings . . . washington right now who are killing jobs and i'll tell you , i know who they are . i will find them and i will fire them . 
bush who can you count on to keep us safer , stronger and freer ? results count , and as governor , i pushed florida up to the top in terms of jobs , income and small business growth . detailed plans count , and i believe that the plan i've laid out to destroy isis before the tragedies of san bernardino and paris are the right ones . credibility counts . there'll be people here that will talk about what they're going to do . i've done it . i ask for your support to build , together , a safer and stronger america .

christie and why don't we do the same thing with planned parenthood ? 
fiorina jake , i'll tell you i'll tell you why people are supporting outsiders . it's because you know what happens if someone's been in the system their whole life , they don't know how broken the system is . a fish swims in water , it doesn't know it's water . it's not that politicians are bad people , it's that they've been in that system forever . the truth is 75 percent of the american people think the government is corrupt ; 82 percent of the american people think these problems that have festered for 50 years in some cases , 25 years in other cases . the border's been insecure for 25 years ; 307 , 000 veterans have died waiting for health care . these things have gone on for so long because no one will challenge the status quo . you know what a leader does ? they challenge the status quo , they solve problems that have festered for a long time and they produce results . that is what my whole life has been about . people know this is about far more than replacing a d with an r 
rubio that's what they got for 36 , 000 . 
trump well , four years ago , i said , bomb the oil and take the oil . and if we did that , they wouldn't have the wealth they have right now . now , i still say the same thing , because we're doing little pinpricks . we're not even bombing if somebody's driving a truck , they give notice to the person driving the truck , we're going to bomb . if they don't get out of the truck , the truck sails away with the oil . we actually have a case where we don't want to bomb the oil , because we don't want to hurt pollute the atmosphere . can you imagine general douglas macarthur or general patton saying we can't bomb because we're gonna hurt the atmosphere ? you have to knock the hell out of the oil . you have to take the oil . and you have also back channels of banking . you have people that you think are our great allies , our friends , in the middle east , that are paying tremendous numbers of tremendous amounts of money to isis . so we have to stop those circuits . nobody knows banking better than i do . they have back circuits , back channels . tremendous amounts of money is coming in through the banking system . so between the oil and the banking , you will dry them up . but it should have been done four years ago , not now . 
trump inaudible i took . . . 
carson well , i think the bully pulpit is a wonderful place to start healing that divide . you know , we have the purveyors of hatred who take every single incident between people of two races and try to make a race war out of it , and drive wedges into people . and this does not need to be done . what we need to think about instead you know , i was asked by an npr reporter once , why don't i talk about race that often . i said it's because i'm a neurosurgeon . and she thought that was a strange response . and you say i said , you see , when i take someone to the operating room , i'm actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are . the skin doesn't make them who they are . the hair doesn't make them who they are . and it's time for us to move beyond that . because . . . . . . our strength as a nation comes in our unity . we are the united states of america , not the divided states . and those who want to destroy us are trying to divide us , and we shouldn't let them do it . 
bush there are 13 , 000 community based organizations that provide health services to women , 13 , 000 in this country . i don't believe that planned parenthood should get a penny from the federal government . those organizations should get funding , just as i increased funding when i was governor of the state . that's the way you do this is you improve the condition for people . and , donald , when i was governor , we also increased the opportunities for women . women's income grew three times faster than the national average when i was governor . 
cruz but more broadly , you know , the notion marco is suggesting , that somehow he also has tossed more than a few insults this direction let's be absolutely clear . isis and radical islamic terrorism will face no more determined foe than i will be . we will utterly destroy them by targeting the bad guys . and one of the problems with marco's foreign policy is he has far too often supported hillary clinton and barack obama undermining governments in the middle east that have helped radical islamic terrorists . we need to focus on killing the bad guys , not getting stuck in middle eastern civil wars that don't keep america safe . 
bush so you the the first chance . . . 
rubio donald , you said he's a strong leader . 
trump no , no , no . 
kasich ok , let me let me let me just talk about that , because i know that that donald believes the energy industry is important . so do i . but of the over 400 , 000 jobs that we've created in the state , we think maybe 15 , 000 are connected to this industry , because it's early stage . see , what we've done in ohio , and what a president needs to do , is to have a cabinet and a whole operation that's jobs friendly . we have diversified our economy . we we do have energy , we have medical devices , we have financial services , we have i . t . , we just got amazon their cloud computing in the midwest . you know why it's happening ? bell ringing because we're balanced budgets , we're strong , we're job friendly , we don't raise their taxes , and if we have a president that does that in america , we will get the economic growth , and that is what this country needs . jobs , jobs and jobs , period . 
trump i was against the giving of the money at all cost . i said don't negotiate at all until you get the prisoners back . if the prisoners don't come back early three years ago . one of the longest negotiations i've ever seen , by the way . if they don't come back early , i was saying don't negotiate . they come back early . what you do is you take it back and you say , either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions . what we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal . cause that deal is a disaster . ted , the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very , very poor negotiators . but that money , the 150 billion , is largely gone and already spent everywhere but the united states . 
rubio that sounds like people are afraid the president's going to take their guns away . look , the second amendment is not an option . it is not a suggestion . it is a constitutional right of every american to be able to protect themselves and their families . i am convinced that if this president could confiscate every gun in america , he would . i am convinced that this president , if he could get rid of the second amendment , he would . i am convinced because i see how he works with his attorney general , not to defend the second amendment , but to figure out ways to undermine it . i have seen him appoint people to our courts not to defend the second amendment , but to figure out ways to undermine it . here's my second problem . none of these instances that the president points to as the reason why he's doing these things would have been preventive . you know why ? because criminals don't buy their guns from a gun show . they don't buy their guns from a collector . and they don't buy their guns from a gun store . they get they steal them . they get them on the black market . and let me tell you , isis and terrorists do not get their guns from a gun show . these . . . laughter and applause . . . his answer you name it . if there's an act of violence in america , his immediate answer before he even knows the facts is gun control . here's a fact . we are in a war against isis . they are trying to attack us here in america . they attacked us in philadelphia last week . they attacked us in san bernardino two weeks ago . and the last line standing between them and our families might be us and a gun . when i'm president of the united states , we are defending the second amendment , not undermining it the way barack obama does . 
bush . . . so that we can destroy islamic terrorism . 
kasich well , let me let me first of all talk a little bit about my experience . i served on the defense committee for 18 years , and by the way , one of the members of that committee was senator strom thurmond from south carolina . let em also tell you . . . . . . that after the 9 11 attacks , secretary rumsfeld invited me to the pentagon with a meeting of the former secretaries of defense . and in that meeting , i suggested we had a problem with technology , and that i wanted to take people from silicon valley into the pentagon to solve our most significant problems . so i not only had the opportunity to go through the cold war struggles in central america , and even after 9 11 to be involved . with saudi arabia and oil production , first of all , it's so critical for us to be energy independent , and we're getting there because of fracking and we ought to explore because , see , energy independence gives us leverage and flexibility , and secondly , if you want to bring jobs back to the united states of america in industry , low prices make the difference . we're seeing it in my state and we'll see it in this country . and that's why we must make sure we continue to frack . in terms of saudi arabia , look , my biggest problem with them is they're funding radical clerics through their madrasses . that is a bad deal and an evil situation , and presidents have looked the other way . and i was going to tell you , whether i'm president or not , we better make it clear to the saudis that we're going to support you , we're in relation with you just like we were in the first gulf war , but you've got to knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics who are the very people who try to destroy us and will turn around and destroy them . so look , in foreign policy in foreign policy , it's strength , but you've got to be cool . you've got to have a clear vision of where you want to go . and i'm going to tell you , that it i'm going to suggest to you here tonight , that you can't do on the job training . i've seen so much of it a soviet union , the coming down of a wall , the issues that we saw around the world in central america , the potential spread of communism , and 9 11 and gulf war . you see what the saudi's deliver them a strong message but at the end of the day we have to keep our cool because most of the time they're going right with us . and they must be part of our coalition to destroy isis and i believe we can get that done . thank you . 
cruz well , you know , your question highlights a sharp difference on immigration on this stage . you know , in a republican primary , everyone talks tough on immigration . everyone is against illegal immigration in a republican primary . but as voters , we've been burned over and over again by people that give us a great campaign speech and they don't walk the walk . there are sharp differences on amnesty . if you look at the folks on this stage , when harry reid and chuck schumer and establishment republicans were leading the fight to pass a massive amnesty plan , i stood with jeff sessions and steve king and the american people and led the fight to defeat that amnesty plan . 
kasich well , as president , i will make this a nation that will solve problems . and how ? by having the elected officials and the leaders realize they're americans before they're republicans or democrats . i did it in washington . and i've done it in ohio by having the elected officials realize that they're ohioans before anything else . secondly , i will rebuild the relationships and show the respect to our allies around the world . we have no choice but to do that . we will be stronger when we are unified . and we'll fight for freedom and for human rights . and finally , a little bit of what carly said . the people that are out there listening , america was never great because we ran america from the top down . america is great because we have run america from the bottom up , where we all live in the neighborhoods . one more time in america , we need to revive the concept of citizenship , where everybody's actions make a huge difference in changing the world . we have a holocaust memorial on our state house grounds . and there is one line on there that stands out all the time . if you've saved one life , you've changed the world . we need to adopt that as citizens and rebuild and reinspire our country . thank you . 
bush the great majority of people that come to this country come because they have no other choice . they want to come to provide for their families . that doesn't mean it's right . that doesn't mean it's right . we should pick who comes to our country . we should control our border . coming here legally should be a lot easier than coming here illegally . but the motivation , they're not all rapists , as you know who said . they're not that . these are people that are coming to provide for their families . and we should show a little more respect for the fact that they're struggling . it doesn't mean we shouldn't be controlling the border . that's exactly what we should be doing . 
trump you know , i listen and i watch ted on television and when he speaks , and he's always saying , i'm the only one that beat donald in six contests ; and i beat him . but i beat him in 13 contests . he never mentions that . and let me just tell you another little fact , little minor fact . i have about a 1 . 6 million votes during this primary season , more votes than ted . the other thing is , i beat hillary , and i will give you the list , i beat hillary in many of the polls that have been taken . and each week , i get better and better . and believe me , i haven't even started on her yet . 
cruz major , i get a response to that . 
christie stop and stop playing and carly carly , listen . you can interrupt everybody else on this stage , you're not going to interrupt me , ok ? the fact is that we don't want to hear about your careers , back and forth and volleying back and forth about who did well and who did poorly . you're both successful people . congratulations . you know who's not successful ? the middle class in this country who's getting plowed over by barack obama and hillary clinton . let's start talking about those issues tonight and stop this childish back and forth between the two of you . 
huckabee . . . is paid played fairly . 
walker well first off , for the cyber attack with russia the other day , it's sad to think right now , but probably the russian and chinese government know more about hillary clinton's e mail server than do the members of the united states congress . laughter and applause and and that has put our national security at risk . if i am president , he won't think about that . you know , putin believes in the old lenin adage you probe with bayonets . when you find mush , you push . when you find steel , you stop . under obama and clinton , we found a lot of mush over the last two years . we need to have a national security that puts steel in front of our enemies . i would send weapons to ukraine . i would work with nato to put forces on the eastern border of poland and the baltic nations , and i would reinstate , put in place back in the missile defense system that we had in poland and in the czech republic . we find steel . 
rubio there's a broader issue here , hugh . and there's a broader issue here as well . first of all , the only people that follow the law are law abiding people . criminals by definition ignore the law , so you can pass all the gun laws in the world , like the left wants . the criminals are going to ignore it because they are criminals . here's the real issue . the real issue the real issue is not what are people using to commit violence , but why are they committing the violence ? and here's the truth because you cannot separate the social , moral wellbeing of your people from their economic and other wellbeing . you cannot separate it . you can't have a strong country without strong people , you cannot have strong people without strong values , and you cannot have strong values without strong families and the institutions in this country that defend and support those families . 
cruz at least half of the things marco said are flat out false . they're absolutely false . 
kasich thank you . 
trump one thing i'd like to add to what the governor's saying , i think that we are now in a position are 19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago , it's going to be 21 trillion dollars . we can no longer defend all of these countries , japan , germany , south korea . you order televisions , you order almost anything , you're getting it from these countries . whether it's a mercedes benz , or whether it's an air conditioning unit . they're coming out of these countries . they are making a fortune . saudi arabia , we are defending saudi arabia . before the oil went down , now they're making less , but they're making plenty . they were making 1 billion dollars a day . bell ringing we defend all of these countries for peanuts . you talk about budgets . we have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries . 
huckabee gosh , i'd love for us to talk about something like that . thank you . 
bush well , first of all , under president jeb bush , we would restore the strength of the military . last week , secretary carter announced that the navy's going to be cut again . it's now half the size of what it was prior to operation desert storm . the deployments are too high for the military personnel . we don't have procurement being done for refreshing the equipment . the b 52 is still operational as the long range bomber ; it was inaugurated in the age of harry truman . the planes are older than the pilots . we're gutting our military , and so the iranians and the chinese and the russians and many other countries look at the united states not as serious as we once were . we have to eliminate the sequester , rebuild our military in a way that makes it clear that we're back in the game . secondly , as it relates to iran , we need to confront their ambitions across the board . we should reimpose sanctions , they've already violated sanctions after this agreement was signed by testing medium range missiles . thirdly , we need to move our embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem to send a serious signal that we're back in the game with israel . . . . . . and sign an agreement that makes sure that the world knows that they will have technological superiority . we need to get back in the game as it relates to our arab nations . the rest of the world is moving away from us towards other alliances because we are weak . this president and john kerry and hillary clinton all have made it harder for the next president to act , but he must act to confront the ambitions of iran . we can get back in the game to restore order and security for our own country . 
trump carly , carly 
paul the greatest threat to our national security is our debt . we borrow a million dollars a minute . and whose fault is it ? well , frankly , it's both parties' fault . you have those on the right who clamor and say , oh , we will spend anything on the military , and those on the left who say the same for domestic welfare . but what most americans don't realize is there is an unholy alliance . they come together . there's a secret handshake . we spend more money on everything . and we are not stronger nation if we go further into debt . we are not projecting power from bankruptcy court . to me , there is no greater threat than our debt . i'm the only fiscal conservative on the stage because i'm willing to hold the line on all spending . i hope you will consider me in the election . thank you very much . 
bush so , are we going to ban muslims from india , from indonesia , from countries that are strong allies that we need to build better relationships with ? of course not . what we need to do is destroy isis . i laid out a plan at the citadel to do just that and it starts with creating a no fly zone and safe zones to make sure refugees are there . we need to lead a force , a sunni led force inside of syria . we need to embed with with the iraqi military . we need to arm the kurds the directly . we need to re establish the relationships with the sunnis . we need the lawyers off the back of the war fighters . that's how you solve the problem . you don't solve it by big talk where you're banning all muslims and making it harder for us to build the kind of coalition for us to be successful . 
rubio well , i understand why they feel that way , because this president hasn't kept us safe . the problem is we had an attack in san bernardino . and we were paying attention to the most important issue we have faced in a decade since 9 11 , and then all the talk was about this proposal , which isn't going to happen . but this is what's important to do is we must deal frontally with this threat of radical islamists , especially from isis . this is the most sophisticated terror group that has ever threatened the world or the united states of america . they are actively recruiting americans . the attacker in san bernardino was an american citizen , born and raised in this country . he was a health inspector ; had a newborn child and left all that behind to kill 14 people . we also understand that this is a group that's growing in its governance of territory . it's not just iraq and syria . they are now a predominant group in libya . they are beginning to pop up in afghanistan . they are increasingly involved now in attacks in yemen . they have jordan in their sights . this group needs to be confronted with serious proposals . and this is a very significant threat we face . and the president has left us unsafe . he spoke the other night to the american people to reassure us . i wish he hadn't spoken at all . he made things worse . because what he basically said was we are going to keep doing what we're doing now , and what we are doing now is not working . 
carson yes . well , first of all , i think it would be a pretty easy contrast , quite frankly , between myself and hillary clinton . in one case , you have someone who is known as a deceitful individual . an individual who at benghazi , which i will never let go , quite frankly , because i think of those two men who went up there on the top of that compound with machine guns , firing away , allowing their colleagues to escape . and i'm sure , in the back of their mind , they were just saying , if we can just hold on , help is on the way . but help was not on the way . when did we in the united states not send people to help our own people ? you know , this is not who we are . and i would simply make it a referendum on honesty and integrity versus deceit and the washington way . 
cruz well , sure . it starts with a commander in chief that sets the objective . and the objective has to be utterly and completely destroying isis . obama hasn't started with that objective and everything else flows from there . once you set that objective , we have the tools to carry that out . the first tool is overwhelming air power . it is one of the blessings of the united states of america , having the greatest military on the face of the earth , is we have the ability to use that air power . as you know , in the first persian gulf war , it was 1 , 100 air attacks a day . obama is launching between 15 and 30 . now , when i say saturation carpet bombing , that is not indiscriminate . that is targeted at oil facilities . it's targeted at the oil tankers . it's targeted at command and control locations . it's targeted at infrastructure . it's targeted at communications . it's targeted at bombing all of the roads and bridges going in and out of raqqa . it's using overwhelming air power . you know , couple of weeks ago , it was reported that a facility is open called jihadist university . now , the question i wonder , why is that building still standing ? it should be rubble . and if you had a president . . . bell rings . . . all though i will say this . i would be willing to wait until freshman orientation before launching those bombs . 
christie i understand . no , no , listen , everybody makes a mistake every once in a while , jake , even george shultz . and if that's truly a representation of what he believes we should be doing , then with all due respect to the former secretary of state , i disagree with him . 
trump i don't know . you feel safe right now ? i don't feel so safe . 
kasich . . . i'm gonna tell you this . let me tell you this . if during if during . . . 
rubio dana , i was mentioned in his response , so if i may about the insurance companies . . . 
rubio jake , you mentioned me and called me a denier . let me say , climate change . . . 
trump well , let let me let me just say let me just say this . look , i watched ted and i respected it , but he gets nowhere stand on the senate floor for a day or two days , and talk and talk and talk . i watched the other senators laughing and smiling . and when ted was totally exhausted , he left the senate floor , and they went back to work . ok ? we have to have somebody that's going to make deals . it's wonderful to stand up for two days and do that . now , ted's been very critical i have a sister who's a brilliant . . . 
kasich he says he didn't mention me the second time . i thought i heard it , jeb . no . i'm just kidding . thank you all very much for listening and being patient with all of us tonight . thank you . 
trump because the country will become a dynamic economy . we'll be dynamic again . if you look at what's going on , we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world . we pay more business tax , we pay more personal tax . we have the highest taxes in the world . it's shutting off our economy . it's shutting off our country . we have trillions of dollars outside that we can't get in . yes , we will do my tax plan , and it will be great . we will have a dynamic economy again . 
bush no , no , i wouldn't . no , i wouldn't . and it was used sparingly , congress has changed the laws and i and i think where we stand is the appropriate place . but what we need to do is to make sure that we expand our intelligence capabilities . the idea that we're going to solve this fight with predator drones , killing people somehow is a is more acceptable than capturing them , securing the information . this is why closing guantanamo is a complete disaster . what we need to do is make sure that we are kept safe . . . . . . by having intelligence capabilities , both human and technological intelligence capabilities far superior than what we have today . that's how you get a more safe place is by making sure that we're fully engaged . and right now , this administration doesn't do that . 
kasich that was a pretty good one . 
bush well , i i wanted to be make it easier for him . 
bush martha and david , i just . . . 
carson first of all , let me just complain a little bit . this is the first time i've spoken and several people have had multiple questions so please try to pay attention to that . now , as far as monitoring is concerned , what my point is , we need to make sure that any place i don't care whether it's a mosque , a school , a supermarket , a theater , you know it doesn't matter . if there are a lot of people getting there and engaging in radicalizing activities then we need to be suspicious of it . we have to get rid of all this pc stuff . and people are worried about if somebody's going to say that i'm islamophobic or what have you . this is craziness because we are at war . that's why i asked congress , go ahead and declare the war . we need to be on a war footing . we need to understand that our nation is in grave danger . you know , what the muslim brotherhood said in the explanatory memorandum that was discovered during the holy land foundation trial was that , they will take advantage of our pc attitude to get us . we have to be better than this . we have to be smarter than they are . 
trump we don't need that . that's essentially what we have now , and we don't need that . and that's why we're in the trouble that we're in now . and by the way , jeb you mentioned boeing , take a look . they order planes , they make boeing build their plant in china . they don't want them made here . they want those planes made in china . 
bush . . . this is coming from a guy who gets his foreign policy from the shows . 
trump i think richard haass is excellent . i have a lot of respect for him . i think general keane is excellent . i think that there are i like colonel jacobs very much . i see him . i know him . i have many people that i think are really excellent but in the end it's going to be my decision . when you just asked the question about snowden , i will tell you right from the beginning , i said he was a spy and we should get him back . and if russia respected our country , they would have sent him back immediately , but he was a spy . it didn't take me a long time to figure that one out . believe me . but i would get the best people , people that i'd be comfortable with . and we will do the right thing . 
trump listen , just one second . just one second . 
trump . . . for the obvious reason , and he can't do it because he doesn't know how to tell the truth . other than that , i rest my case . crosstalk 
bush no way . believe me . 
carson can i just add one very quick thing ? and i just want to say , you know , last week we released our tax plan . and multiple reputable journals , including the wall street journal , said ours is the best . just want to get that out there , just saying . 
carson you know , when i entered this race , all the political pundits said it's impossible ; you can't do it because you're not connected with the money . and there's no way that you can raise what you need in order to compete successfully . i in no way am willing to get in the bed with special interest group or lick the boots of billionaires . i have said to the people if they want me to do this , please get involved . and we now have over 500 , 000 donations , and the money is coming in . but the pundits forgot about one thing , and that is the people . and they are really in charge . 
paul yes , i would like to finish my response , basically . 
rubio correct . 
rubio did ted cruz fight to support legalizing people that are in this country illegally ? 
rubio no , but this is not about deportation . everybody always goes immediately to the issue of deportation . this is about daca . daca is an executive order that is unconstitutional . i will cancel it on my first day in office , which means people who currently hold those permits will not be allowed to renew them when they expire , and new people will not be allowed to apply for them . now , i am sympathetic to the plight of someone who came here when they were 2 or 3 years old through no fault of their own , but you can't solve it doing something that is unconstitutional . no matter how sympathetic we may be to a cause , we cannot violate the constitution of the united states the way this president now does on a regular basis . 
trump where did i support it ? where did i . . . 
carson well , i'm very happy to get a question this early on . i was going to ask you to wake me up when that time came . laughter you know , i find it really quite fascinating some of the president's proclamations . the fact of the matter is he doesn't realize that we now live in the 21st century , and that war is very different than it used to be before . not armies massively marching on each other and air forces , but now we have dirty bombs and we have cyber attacks and we have people who will be attacking our electrical grid . and , you know , we have a whole variety of things that they can do and they can do these things simultaneously . and we have enemies who are obtaining nuclear weapons that they can explode in our exoatmosphere and destroy our electric grid . i mean , just think about a scenario like that . they explode the bomb , we have an electromagnetic pulse . they hit us with a cyberattack simultaneously and dirty bombs . can you imagine the chaos that would ensue at that point ? he needs to recognize that those kinds of things are in fact an existential threat to us . but here's the real key . we have the world's best military , even though he's done everything he can to diminish it . and the fact of the matter is if we give them a mission and we don't tie their hands behind their back , they can get it accomplished . 
kasich how do you how do you get that extra time , cruz ? you're very good at . . . 
trump o . k . , governor . 
trump no , i won't do that , because i've said nothing wrong . 
cruz for most of his life , his policies have been very , very liberal . for most of his life , he has described himself as very pro choice and as a supporter of partial birth abortion . right now , today , as a candidate , he supports federal taxpayer funding for planned parenthood . i disagree with him on that . that's a matter of principle , and i'll tell you . . . 
bush this is a tough business to run for president . 
trump or the collapse of the economy . 
cruz let me be clear . the men and women on this stage have more ideas , more experience , more common sense than every participant in the democratic debate . that debate reflected a debate between the bolsheviks and the mensheviks . laughter and nobody watching at home believed that any of the moderators had any intention of voting in a republican primary . the questions that are being asked shouldn't be trying to get people to tear into each other . it should be what are your substantive positions . . . crosstalk 
trump don't worry about it , little marco . crosstalk 
bush no . he mentioned my name . 
bush well , first of all , we need to destroy isis in the caliphate . that's that should be our objective . the refugee issue will be solved if we destroy isis there , which means we need to have a no fly zone , safe zones there for refugees and to build a military force . we need to embed our forces our troops inside the iraqi military . we need to arm directly the kurds . and all of that has to be done in concert with the arab nations . and if we're going to ban all muslims , how are we going to get them to be part of a coalition to destroy isis ? the kurds are the greatest fighting force and our strongest allies . they're muslim . look , this is not a serious proposal . in fact , it will push the muslim world , the arab world away from us at a time when we need to reengage with them to be able to create a strategy to destroy isis . so donald , you know , is great at at the one liners , but he's a chaos candidate . and he'd be a chaos president . he would not be the commander in chief we need to keep our country safe . 
bush i'm jeb bush , and i believe america's on the verge of its greatest century , and i'm ready to lead . i'm a committed , conservative reformer that cut taxes , that balanced budgets , that took on the special interest in florida , and we won . i look forward to talking tonight about how we can fix a broken washington d . c . , and create an environment where people can rise up again in this great country . thank you . 
trump i have heard ted say that over and over again on television , that he is the only one that can beat me . just , for the record , i have won 10 . he has won three or four . last week , in fact , on tuesday , i was a half a million votes higher than him . i was a million votes higher than marco , 1 million votes . that's a lot of votes . and was by far in first place . so i keep hearing that he is the only one that can beat me but he is getting beaten very , very badly . so where does this come from ? where does it come from ? 
trump first of all , the when you say i'm the only candidate , if you listen to the democrats , they want to do many things to social security , and i want to do them on its own merit . you listen to them , what they want to do to social security , none of these folks are getting elected , o . k . , whether they can do it or not . i'm going to save social security . i'm going to bring jobs back from china . i'm going to bring jobs back from mexico and from japan , where they're all every country throughout the world now vietnam , that's the new one . they are taking our jobs . they are taking our wealth . they are taking our base . and you and i have had this discussion . we're going to make our economy strong again . i'm lowering taxes . we have 2 . 5 trillion offshore . we have 2 . 5 trillion that i think is actually five trillion because the government has no idea when they say 2 . 5 , they have no idea what they're doing or saying , as they've proven very well . we're going to bring that money back . you take a look at what happened just this week . china bought the chicago stock exchange , china , a chinese company . carrier is moving to mexico , air conditioning company . not only the ones i talk about all the time , nabisco and ford and they're all moving out . we have an economy that last quarter , g . d . p . didn't grow . it was flat . we have to make our economy grow again . we're dying . this country is dying . and our workers are losing their jobs , and you're going . . . 
trump waste , fraud and abuse all over the place . waste , fraud and abuse . you look at what's happening with social security , you look look at what's happening with every agency waste , fraud and abuse . we will cut so much , your head will spin . 
trump . . . first of all , he's talking about the polls . i'm beating him awfully badly in the polls . crosstalk 
kasich if you're in the business of selling things , if you're not going to sell to somebody you don't agree with , today i'm not going to sell to somebody who's gay , then tomorrow maybe i won't sell to somebody who's divorced . end video clip 
christie let me say this , jake , is that while that may have been a fine idea that dr . carson had , these people were out to kill us . i stood in that region with my family , and every time a plane went overhead in the weeks after that , people's heads jerked to the sky because they thought it was happening again . you do not need to go through subtle diplomacy at that point . that could be handled later on . what you need is a strong american leader who will take the steps that are necessary to protect our nation . that's what i would do as commander in chief in this circumstance . and that's what president george w . bush did in 2001 . 
carson this is great you guys . i want you all to mention me when you say something . laughter in fact , the time line indicates that initial tweet from cnn was followed by another one within one minute that clarified that i was not dropping out . so , what happened to that one , it is unclear . but the bottom line is , we can see what happened , everybody can see what happened and you can make your own judgment . 
rubio yeah , a couple points . if he builds the wall the way he built trump towers , he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it . the second . . . 
fiorina that is exactly what president obama said . i'm amazed to hear that from a republican presidential candidate . but let's just start with , who got it wrong ? who really got it wrong ? hillary clinton has gotten every foreign policy challenge wrong . hitting the reset button with vladimir putin recall that she called bashar al assad a positive reformer and then she opened an embassy and then later she said , over , and over , and over again , bashar al assad must go . although she wasn't prepared to do anything about it . recall that hillary clinton was all for toppling gadhafi then didn't listen to her own people on the ground . and then of course , when she lied about the terrorist attack in benghazi , she invited more terrorist attacks . 
bush well , if the law would change , yeah . but i think there has to be recognition that if we if we are too punitive , then you'll go to other other technology companies outside the united states . and what we want to do is to control this . we also want to dominate this from a commercial side . so there's a lot of balanced interests . but the president leads in this regard . that's what we need . we need leadership , someone who has a backbone and sticks with things , rather than just talks about them as though anything matters when you're talking about amendments that don't even actually are part of a bill that ever passed . 
fiorina living in extreme poverty is the highest level on record . i am a conservative because i know our values , our principles and our policies 
kasich . . . and assert ourselves as america . 
carson i've been fortunate enough to travel to 58 different countries and i thank god everyday that i was born in this country . the most exceptional country that the world has ever known . and i want to make sure that we preserve that exceptionalism for the next generation . my mother told me if i work hard and i really believed in american principles and i believed in god , anything is possible . i believe that is true , and that's why i'm not anxious to give away american values and principles for the sake of political correctness . 
trump not with this intensity . 
kasich wait , megyn , the court has ruled , and i said we'll accept it . and guess what , i just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay . because somebody doesn't think the way i do , doesn't mean that i can't care about them or can't love them . so if one of my daughters happened to be that , of course i would love them and i would accept them . because you know what ? that's what we're taught when we have strong faith . so the issues like that , issues like that are planted to divide us . i think the simple fact of the matter is , and this is where i would agree with jeb , and i've been saying it all along , we need to give everybody a chance , treat everybody with respect , and let them share in this great american dream that we have , megan . so , look , i'm going to love my daughters , i'm going to love them no matter what they do . because , you know what , timer sounds god gives me unconditional love . i'm going to give it to my family and my friends and the people around me . 
trump no , it's a private job . 
bush and so we do agree , mike . 
trump mr . trump , you're doing a great job . i have his book . crosstalk 
cruz that is absolutely false . what he said is knowingly false . and i would note , if you want to assess if you want to assess . . . 
kasich well , look , first of all , i try to be a man of faith every day as best as i can , and i try to focus in my faith on the dos and i think the don'ts will take care of themselves once i get the dos right , which is humility , and loving my enemy , and caring for my neighbor . but secondly , look , you're in the commerce business , you want to sell somebody a cupcake , great . ok ? but now if they ask you to participate in something you really don't like , that's a whole 'nother issue , ok ? another issue . here's what i'd like to see happen . the supreme court ruled , i don't agree with the ruling . i'm of favor of marriage between you know , traditional marriage , a man and a woman . what i hope was going to happen after the supreme court ruling is things would settle down . if you go to a photographer to take pictures at your wedding , and he says , i'd rather not do it , find another photographer , don't sue them in court . you know what , the problem is in our country in our country , we need to learn to respect each other and be a little bit more tolerant for one another . and at the end of the day , don't go to court . can't we have common sense in america ? that's the way it used to be . and there was a book written called the death of common sense . we need to bring it back . but at the end of the day , if somebody is being pressured to participate in something that is against their deeply held religious beliefs , then we're going to have to think about dealing with the law . but you know what , i'd rather people figure this out without having to put another law on the books and have more arguments in this country . why don't we come together as a country , respect one another , love one another and lift this country ? i think that's what people want . so thanks for asking . 
cruz i think it is a very important question because the people who have been hurt the most in the obama economy had been the most vulnerable . it's been young people . it's been hispanics . it's been african americans . it's been single moms . we have the lowest percentage of americans working today in any year since 1977 . and the sad reality is big government , massive taxes , massive regulation , doesn't work . what we need to do instead is bring back booming economic growth , let small businesses are the heart of the economy . two thirds of all new jobs come from small businesses . if we want to lift people out of poverty you know , i think of these issues from the perspective of my dad . my dad fled cuba in 1957 . he was just 18 . he couldn't speak english . he had nothing . he had 100 in his underwear . and he washed dishes making 50 cents an hour and paid his way through school . today , my dad is a pastor . he travels the country preaching the gospel . now , i think about all of these issues . how would it impact my dad when he was washing dishes ? if we had obamacare in place right now , the odds are very high my father would have been laid off , because it's teenaged kids like my dad who have gotten laid off . if he didn't get laid off , the odds are high he would have had his hours forcibly reduced to 28 , 29 hours a week . we need to lift the burdens on small businesses so you have jobs , and we need welfare reform that gets people off of welfare and back to work . 
kasich for too long no , for too long , what happens is somebody dumps their product in our country and take our people's jobs , and then we go to an international court and it takes them like a year or two to figure out whether they were cheating us . and guess what ? the worker's out of a job . so when they be found against that country that's selling products in here lower than the cost of what it takes to produce them , then what do we tell the worker ? oh , well , you know , it just didn't work out for you . i think we should be for free trade but i think fair trade . and when countries violate trade agreements or dump product in this country , we need we need to stand up against those countries that do that without making them into an enemy . and i want to just suggest to you . how do i know this ? because so many people in my family worked in steel mills , and they didn't work with a white collar , they worked in a blue collar . and the fact is those jobs are critical , they're hard working members of the middle class and they need to be paid attention to because they're americans and they carry the load . so let's demand open trade but fair trade in this country . that's what i think we need to do . 
rubio why don't you make them in america ? 
fiorina . . . the more the big , the powerful , the wealthy and the well connected are advantaged . 
bush look , first of all , i wrote a book about this , three four years ago , now . and i laid out a comprehensive , conservative approach for immigration reform . and it does require securing the border . no one disagrees with that . but to build a wall , and to deport people half a million a month would cost hundreds of billions of dollars , donald . hundreds of billions of dollars . it would destroy community life , it would tear families apart . and it would send a signal to the rest of the world that the united states values that are so important for our long term success no longer matter in this country . 
trump megyn , i have a very strong core . i have a very strong core . but i've never seen a successful person who wasn't flexible , who didn't have a certain degree of flexibility . you have to have a certain degree of flexibility . you can't for instance , let's say , on on the second question , you can't say it's ok , and then you find out it's not ok , and you don't want to do anything . you have to be flexible , because you learn . i mean , before i knew the question was asked by bill , and the next day , or the couple of days later , the question was asked by , by you know i was asked by a number of people , actually . i was asked by sean , but i was asked by a number of people . but by that time , the number had increased significantly . 
cruz thank you . thank thank thank you very much . you know , it's interesting donald went went on on an extended tirade about the polls , but he didn't respond to any of the substance . he has yet to say he can release past year's tax returns . he can do it tomorrow . he doesn't want to do it , because presumably there's something in there . . . 
kasich i don't i haven't seen the provisions of that bill , jake . my initial instincts are no . and let me just say about the v . a . when a veteran comes home , they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time , number one . number two , the veterans administration needs to be restructured . it needs to be downsized and spread out . it needs to be so responsive to the needs of the veterans . and secondly , the pentagon needs to share the information of returning veterans with the veterans' service operations in the states and with the job people in the states so that when a veteran comes home , they can be linked with a job . and when that happens , that means that every veteran will get work , because they're our golden employees . no veteran ought to be without healthcare ; no veteran ought to be homeless ; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the united states of america . 
fiorina no , the federal government should not play a larger role . look , every time the federal government gets engaged in something it gets worse . and then the government steps in to try and solve the problem and we get a little further down to that progressive vision that hillary clinton is talking about . companies should , if they want to attract the best workers , provide a good set of benefits . but honestly , if you're a small business owner today you are being crushed . we have 400 , 000 small businesses forming every year in this country . how great is that ? they are employing themselves , they are potentially employing others . the bad news is , we have 470 , 000 going out of business every year . and why ? they cite obamacare . they are refusing to . . . 
cruz wolf , i'm going to ask my time not be deducted when he's yelling at me . 
kasich well , look , in 1986 ronald reagan basically said the people who were here , if they were law abiding , could stay . but , what didn't happen is we didn't build the walls effectively and we didn't control the border . we need to . we need to control our border just like people have to control who goes in and out of their house . but if people think that we are going to ship 11 million people who are law abiding , who are in this country , and somehow pick them up at their house and ship them out of mexico to mexico , think about the families . think about the children . so , you know what the answer really is ? if they have been law abiding , they pay a penalty . they get to stay . we protect the wall . anybody else comes over , they go back . but for the 11 million people , come on , folks . we all know you can't pick them up and ship them across , back across the border . it's a silly argument . it is not an adult argument . it makes no sense . 
trump that makes it well , you don't know a thing about business . you lose on everything you do . 
trump be quiet . just be quiet . let me talk . i've hired tens of thousands of people . he brings up something from 30 years ago , it worked out very well . everybody was happy . 
rubio . . . because it is a major issue , in your campaign that you've made a center issue . now , as far as my record on it is concerned , i absolutely want to solve this issue . and i did the best we could in a senate that was controlled by liberal democrats and harry reid in the hopes that the house , made up of conservatives , would take it up and make it even stronger . and i said that repeatedly at the time . i'm not just saying that now ; i said it throughout that process . we do need to do with this issue . audience booing when i'm president it will not be dealt with the way it was done in the senate . it will be done first and foremost by bringing illegal immigration under control and proving it to the american people . and only after that is done can anything else happen . and it will be something the american people support . we'll see what they are willing to support . it's not going to be an executive order and we're not going to ram it down their throats . 
bush absolutely . 
trump it's not fear and terror , it's reality . you just have to look today at indonesia , bombings all over . you look at california , you look , frankly , at paris where there's a the strictest no gun policy of any city anywhere in the world , and you see what happens 130 people dead with many to follow . they're very , very badly wounded . they will some will follow . and you look around , and you see what's happening , and this is not the case when he introduced the doctor very nice , everything perfect but that is not representative of what you have in that line of migration . that could be the great trojan horse . it could be people that are going to do great , great destruction . when i look at the migration , i looked at the line , i said it actually on your show recently , where are the women ? it looked like very few women . very few children . strong , powerful men , young and people are looking at that and they're saying what's going on ? you look at the kind of damage that two people that two people that got married , they were radicalized they got married , they killed 15 people in actually 15 going to be probably 16 but you look at that and you take a look a good strong look and that's what we have . we are nineteen trillion dollars our country's a mess and we can't let all these people come into our country and break our borders . we can't do it . 
rubio now , see , i was mentioned by governor . . . 
kasich chris , first of all , i was just saying to chris christie , they say we're outspoken , we need to take lessons from donald trump if we're really going to learn it . here is the thing about donald trump . donald trump is hitting a nerve in this country . he is . he's hitting a nerve . people are frustrated . they're fed up . they don't think the government is working for them . and for people who want to just tune him out , they're making a mistake . now , he's got his solutions . some of us have other solutions . you know , look , i balanced the federal budget as one of the chief architects when i was in washington . hasn't been done since . i was a military reformer . i took the state of ohio from an 8 billion hole and a 350 , 000 job loss to a 2 billion surplus and a gain of 350 , 000 jobs . 
trump . . . no , no , no . . . 
carson wait a minute , who in their 16th month ? 
rubio . . . this isn't just about flexibility . 
trump where did i support ? 
rubio well , i was going for peyton manning , but now i'm rooting for carolina . laughter 
cruz you're not interested in an answer . crosstalk 
christie wolf , you sit up here and you listen to this stuff , and you think that so many of these people have had so much to do in this national debate , they talk like they were bystanders . you know , we talk about our military being degraded over time , and yet we've had folks on this stage who've been a part of congress who have participated in sequester ; who participated in the degrading of this military over time . and that's why i think people get so frustrated with washington , d . c . now . that's why they're so angry with the the electorate is so angry with everybody who is involved in government in washington , d . c . because if you listen to the folks up here , you think that they weren't even there ; they had nothing to do with this . this is a difference between being a governor and being in a legislature . see , because when something doesn't work in new jersey , they look at me , say why didn't it get done ? why didn't you do it ? you have to be responsible and accountable . and so on isis , let's be clear , the president needs to be a force that is trusted in the world . on this i agree with marco . you know , this president is not trusted . if you're the king of jordan , if you're a part of the royal family in saudi arabia and he's made this deal with iran which gives them 150 billion to wage a war and try to extend their empire across the middle east , why would you want to do it now ? but i will tell you this , when i stand across from king hussein of jordan and i say to him , you have a friend again sir , who will stand with you to fight this fight , he'll change his mind . 
trump no , no . but . . . 
trump but i was born here . 
rubio thank you . my name is marco rubio . i'm from florida . my wife jeanette and i are the proud we've been married 17 years , and we're the proud parents of four children , two of whom were able to join us here this evening . i'm honored to be here at the reagan library , at a place that honors the legacy of a man who inspired not just my interest in public service , but also our love for country . and i'm also aware that california has a drought , and so that's why i made sure i brought my own water . laughter 
trump well , i don't know if he's saying that . look , i'm just saying very simply we have a country that i've never seen anything like it . i've been going over budgets and looking at budgets . we don't bid things out . we don't bid out , as an example , the drug industry , pharmaceutical industry . they don't go out to bid . they just pay almost as if you walk into a drug store . that's what they're paying . and the reason is they have a fantastic lobby . they take care of all of the senators , the congressmen . they have great power and they don't bid out . the military is never properly bid . when we go out to military bids , it's not properly bid . and the people that really sell us the product are oftentimes the product we don't want , only because that particular company has political juice , ok ? i'm self funding my campaign . nobody is going to be taking care of me . i don't want anybody's money . i will tell you something . we're going to go out to bid in virtually every different facet of our government . we're going to save a fortune . 
cruz actually that's incorrect . there are two different agreements . there's tpa and tpp . i opposed tpp and have always opposed tpp , which is what you asked about . and when it comes to trade , look , free trade , when we open up foreign markets , helps americans . but we're getting killed in international trade right now . and we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for american workers and jobs are going overseas . we're driving jobs overseas . and the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs , or the steel industry or the auto industry . but i'll tell you who else is going to be losing out , which is the service industry . this obama administration is negotiating the trade in services agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from americans as well . and you've got to understand . trade and immigration are interwoven , and they are hurting the working men and women of this country . so the question is , what's the solution ? it's easy to talk about the problems . but do you have a solution to fix it ? and i think the solution is several things . number one , we need to negotiate trade deals protecting american workers first , not the corporate board room . number two , we need to lift the regulations on american businesses here so we see jobs coming back . and number three , we need a tax plan like the tax plan i've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports , and that will bring millions of high paying jobs back to america . 
trump inaudible 
cruz . . . for our principles . crosstalk 
kasich i want to weigh in on this please . i want to just tell you that the problem is not right now between the administration and apple . you know what the problem is ? where's the president been ? you sit down in a back room and you sit down with the parties and you get this worked out . you don't litigate this on the front page of the new york times , where everybody in the world is reading about their dirty laundry out here . the president of the united states should be convening a meeting , should have convened a meeting with apple and our security forces . and then you know what you do when you're the president ? you lock the door and you say you're not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of americans . this is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it . and i'll tell you , that's why you want a governor . i do this all the time . and we reach agreements all the time . because as an executive , you've got to solve problems instead of fighting on the front page of the newspaper . 
cruz well , maria , you are right . it is extraordinary that of five people standing on this stage that two of us are the children of cuban immigrants . it really is the embodiment of the incredible opportunity and promise this nation provides . you know , i would note that a lot of folks in the media have a definition of hispanics that you can only be hispanic if you're liberal . that makes sense in the media , but i gotta tell you , one of the things i was most proud of when i ran for senate here in texas , i earned 40 percent of the hispanic vote here in texas . at the same time , mitt romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the hispanic vote nationwide . and , the reason is , as you know , you look at the value sin the hispanic community . the values in our community are faith , family , patriotism . you know , we've got the highest rate of military enlistment among hispanics in any demographic in this country . and , when i campaigned , and i campaigned the same here in houston or dallas as i did in the rio grande valley , defending conservative principles , defending judeo christian principals , telling my father's story . telling my dad's story of coming to america with 100 dollars in his underwear , not speaking english , washing dishes , having hopes and dreams for the american dream . and , the truth is the obama clinton economy has done enormous damage to the hispanic community . it is not working in the hispanic community , and i . . . bell ringing . . . fighting so that everyone who is struggling in the hispanic community and beyond will have a fair and even shake at the american dream . 
bush martha martha , if i . . . 
trump yes . 
kasich . . . well , bret , i think we're all really there . i mean , the simple fact is that , you know , you all wrote me off . you wrote me off before i even got to new hampshire , then when i finished in new hampshire you wrote me off in the south , then you wrote me off in super tuesday . i split delegates in vermont with donald trump , i finished second in massachusetts , and we won delegates in virginia . but , guess what ? it's now march madness and we're heading up north to the place to my turf , ok ? cheering and , let me just tell you this , i will win ohio , and i am going to move all across this country , and over time as people begin to finally hear my message you know what people say , bret , to me all the time ? why don't they give you any time on the debate stage ? why is that ? cheering so now all of a sudden , i'm starting to get it , and what i want the people to know is , i know how to bring people together , republicans and democrats . i have successfully , both at the federal level and the state level brought economic growth , wage growth , and economic security to this country . and i want to go back and do it again , and i'm going to keep talking about my message of bringing people together and motivating people in the neighborhoods that realize they don't need somebody from washington galloping in . there are many things they can do where they live , because the strength of our country is in our neighborhoods and our families . and i'm going to keep doing this . 
bush . . . but , if you want to talk about weakness , you want to talk about weakness ? it's weak to disparage women . 
bush sounds like a good plan . 
trump . . . the lines around the states . . . 
carson i haven't had an opportunity to weigh in on foreign policy , and i just want to mention that when the war , when the issue occurred in 2003 , i suggested to president bush that he not go to war ? ok . so i just want that on the record . and , you know , a lot of people are very much against us getting involved right now with global jihadism . and they refer back to our invasion of iraq . and they seem to think that that was what caused it . what caused it was withdrawing from there and creating a vacuum which allowed this terrible situation to occur . but it is very different from what is going on today . we're talking about global jihadists who actually want to destroy us . they are an existential threat to our nation . and we have to be mature enough to recognize that our children will have no future if we put our heads in the sand . we have to recognize we have two choices . we either allow them the continue to progress and appear to be the winners , or we use every resource available to us to destroy . . . 
trump that's true , sure . 
huckabee if you do that , you don't just change the economy , you transform the lives of millions of hurting americans . 
kasich well , first of all , we're running a 2 billion dollar surplus , we're not having a revenue problem right now . and , sending mixed signals to kids about drugs is a disaster . drugs is one of the greatest scourge in this country , and i spent five years of my administration working with my team to do a whole sort of things to try to reign in the problem of overdoses , and it goes on and on . we could do a whole show on that . i want to go back for a second thought on this issue of income inequality . my program would move the 104 programs of the federal department of education into four block grants , and send them back to the states because income inequality is driven by a lack of skills when kids don't get what they need to be able to compete and win in this country . the fact is , in order to get this economy moving again , i call for freezing regulations for a year except for the problem of public safety . i believe that we need to cut these taxes down , we need to be on a roadmap to balancing the budget , and we need to send power , money , and influence , the welfare department , the education department , job training , infrastructure , medicaid , all of that out of washington back to the states so we can run these programs from where we live to the top , not a one size fits all mentality that they have in washington . and , that will get to the nub of opportunity for our children , and an ability to see wages rise . again . . . crosstalk 
huckabee you know , of the few questions i've got , the last one i need is to give him some more time . i love donald trump . he is a good man . i'm wearing a trump tie tonight . get over that one , ok ? crosstalk 
trump you wouldn't have the keystone pipeline that you want so badly without eminent domain . 
carson well , i think we should have policies that don't allow them to just enlarge themselves at the expense of smaller entities . and certainly some of the policies , some of the monetary and fed policies that we're using makes it very easy for them , makes it very easy for the big corporations , quite frankly , at these very low interest rates to buy back their stock and to drive the price of that up artificially . those are the kinds of things that led to the problem in the first place . and i think this all really gets back to this whole regulation issue which is creating a very abnormal situation . this country was declared its independence in 1776 . in less than 100 years , it was the number one economic power in the world . and the reason was because we had an atmosphere that encouraged entrepreneurial risk taking and capital investment . those are the fuels that drive it . and what we've done now is let the creep of regulation turn into a stampede of regulations , which is involved in every aspect of our lives . if we can get that out , it makes a big difference . and even for the average person , every single regulation costs money . and it's shifted to the individual . so and it hurts the poor and the middle class much more than it does the rich . they go into the store and they buy a bar of soap , it costs 10 cents more , they notice it . and the middle class , when they come to the cash register , have a whole cart full of things that cost 5 , 10 or 15 cents more , they notice it . it is hurting the poor . bernie sanders and hillary clinton won't tell you that that's the thing that's really hurting middle class in the core . they'll say it's the rich , take their money , but that won't help . you can take all of the rich's money and it won't make a dent in the problem that we're having . we have to come back to the fundamental principles that made america great . 
trump i've gained great respect for the republican leadership . i've gained great respect for many and i'm going to even say i mean , in different forms for the people on the dais , in different forms . laughter in different forms . but i have great respect for the people i have met through this process . i've never done this process before . i've never been a politician . i mean , for the last six months i've been a politician . but i will tell you , i am totally committed to the republican party . i feel very honored to be the front runner . and i think i'll do very well if i'm chosen . if i'm so fortunate to be chosen , i think i'll do very well . polls have come out recently saying i would beat hillary . i will do everything in my power to beat hillary clinton , i promise you . 
trump well , that's fine . first of all , ted was in favor of amnesty . so there's no question about that . and sheriff joe arpaio recently endorsed me and there's nobody tougher on the borders than sheriff joe . and jeff sessions , one of the most respected senator in washington , an incredible man , also endorsed me . and there's nobody that knows more about the borders than senator jeff sessions . i would say this . we're all in this together . we're going to come up with solutions . we're going to find the answers to things . and so far i cannot believe how civil it's been up here . 
fiorina of your casinos ? 
rubio all right , first of all , the embassy is the former consulate . it's the same building . so it could just go back to being called a consulate . we don't have to close it that way . second of all , i don't know where cuba is going to use , but if they sue us in a court in miami , they're going to lose . laughter and applause third , on the issue of a good deal , i know what the good deal . i'll tell you what the good deal now , it's already codified . here's a good deal cuba has free elections , cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out , cuba has freedom of the press , cuba kicks out the russians from lourdes and kicks out the chinese listening station in berupal cuba stops helping north korea evade u . n . sanctions , cuba takes all of those fugitives of america justice , including that cop killer from new jersey , and send her back to the united states and to jail where she belongs . and you know what ? then we can have a relationship with cuba . that's a good deal . 
trump . . . that makes it well , you don't know a thing about business . you lose on everything . . . 
christie you know why ? because she knows she's wrong , and she cannot look in the mirror at herself , and she cannot tell the american people the truth . 
paul . . . send troops into the middle east . . . 
bush absolutely , i do , and i'm gonna run hard , run with heart , and run to win . i'm gonna have to earn this . maybe the barrier the bar's even higher for me . that's fine . i've got a record in florida . i'm proud of my dad , and i'm certainly proud of my brother . in florida , they called me jeb , because i earned it . i cut taxes every year , totaling 19 billion . we were we had we balanced every budget . we went from 1 billion of reserves to 9 billion of reserves . we were one of two states that went to aaa bond rating . they keep they called me veto corleone . because i vetoed 2 , 500 separate line items in the budget . i am my own man . i governed as a conservative , and i govern effectively . and the net effect was , during my eight years , 1 . 3 million jobs were created . we left the state better off because i applied conservative principles in a purple state the right way , and people rose up . 
cruz . . . but what would you do if the bank was failing ? 
kasich well , i want to thank the people of south carolina . you've been fantastic . and look , what i want you to know is i'm going to send a lot of power , money and influence back to where we all live . but as i've traveled around south carolina , i've noticed something . you know , it's that people have a sense that you're not going to wait on a president . you know , when i was a kid , we didn't wait on presidents to come to that little blue collar town and fix things . you know , the lord made all of us special . the lord wants us to be connected . i believe we're part of a very big mosaic . and i'll send the power back . and whoever gets elected president here , hopefully will take care of the issue of jobs and wages and social security and the border . but the spirit of the america rests in all of us . it's in our guts . it's taking care of our children . it's taking care of the lady next door who just lost her husband . it's fixing the schools where we live and telling kids to stay off drugs . you see , i think what the lord wants is for to us engage , and in america , the spirit of america doesn't come from the top down . the spirit of america rests in us . and i want to call on everyone in america to double down and realize that you were made special to heal this country and lift it for everyone . thank you all very much . and i hope i can have your vote in south carolina . 
christie and and and i you know , ben is absolutely right in saying that what we don't need to do is to send more money to washington , d . c . to fix this problem . and that's what you'll hear from hillary clinton and i've already heard from her is that , send more money in social security , send more money in medicare taxes , send more money for medicaid , and that's gonna solve the problem . what we know is we're living longer . that's a blessing . it's a blessing that we're living longer , so we have to increase the retirement age to reflect that blessing . we need to make sure that people understand , as jeb said before , that if you've done extraordinarily well in this country , do you want them to take more out of your taxes now and think they're gonna give it back to you later ? or would you rather take less later on ? 
rubio yeah . he did . let me i'm proud to serve in the united states senate . you know , when i ran five years ago , the entire leadership of my party in washington lined up against me . but i'm glad i won . and i'm glad that i ran , because this country's headed in the wrong direction . and if we keep electing the same people , nothing is going to change . and you're right , i have missed some votes , and i'll tell you why , mr . trump . because in my years in the senate , i've figured out very quickly that the political establishment in washington , d . c . in both political parties is completely out of touch with the lives of our people . you have millions of people in this country living paycheck to paycheck , and nothing is being done about it . we are about to leave our children with 18 trillion in in in debt , and they're about to raise the debt limit again . we have a world that grows increasingly dangerous , and we are eviscerating our military spending and signing deals with iran . and these if this thing continues , we are going to be the first americans to leave our children worse off than ourselves . that's why i'm missing votes . because i am leaving the senate , i'm not running for re election , and i'm running for president because i know this unless we have the right president , we cannot make america fulfill its potential , but with the right person in office , the 21st century can be the greatest era that our nation has ever known . 
paul how is it conservative ? 
rubio well , make them in america . 
trump you better not attack . . . laughter 
kasich hugh , i've said all along and laid out my foreign policy , i'm going to remind everybody that 55 percent of the foreign policy experts in this country said i was the best to be commander in chief . i spent 18 years on the defense committee , armed services , and then i was in the pentagon with donald rumsfeld after 9 11 , in and out for a couple of years . we absolutely have to win this with a coalition . arabs have to be with us . the europeans have to understand that this threat is closer to them than even is closer is as close as it is to us . and in addition to that , you have to be in the air and you have to be on the ground . and you bring all the force you need . it has got to be shock and awe in the military speak . then once it gets done , and we will wipe them out , once it gets done , it settles down , we come home and let the regional powers redraw the map if that's what it takes . 
cruz neil . . . crosstalk 
cruz . . . exactly right , that we have to defend this nation . you think defending this nation is expensive , try not defending it . that's a lot more expensive . applause and cheering but , you can do that , and pay for it . you can do that , and also be fiscally responsible . you know , i mention that the 25 programs that i put today , that i would eliminate them . among them are corporate welfare , like sugar subsidies . let's take that as an example . sugar subsidies . sugar farmers farm under . . . bell ringing . . . under roughly 0 . 2 of the farmland in america , and yet they give 40 of the lobbying money . that sort of corporate welfare is why we're bankrupting our kids , and grandkids . i would end those subsidies to pay for defending this nation . . . 
rubio well , i would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in , those aren't actually workers at all . they are just coming in primarily based on family connection . and ; let me tell you , when my parents came in 1956 , i acknowledge that my parents came to the u . s . on a family based system . the problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago . the 21st century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills . when my parents came , they had a very limited education . my father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work . and he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school . and i'm grateful every day that america welcomed them . but today in the 21st century , 60 years later , finding jobs when you don't have skills is very difficult . we need to move to a merit based system of immigration , not just on h 1b , particularly on green cards . the primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st century should be , what skills do you have ? what business are you going to open ? what investment are you going to make ? what job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the united states ? 
trump you're the you're the one . you're the one . 
walker that's because of barack that's because of barack obama . 
cruz breathe , breathe , breathe . 
trump . . . competition . . . 
trump . . . and , you don't know what it means . . . 
bush . . . that is outrageous . the guy's an american hero . 
rubio i just want to say , at least on behalf of me and my family , i thank god all the time it was george w . bush in the white house on 9 11 and not al gore . and you can i think you can look back in hindsight and say a couple of things , but he kept us safe . and not only did he keep us safe , but no matter what you want to say about weapons of mass destruction , saddam hussein was in violation of u . n . resolutions , in open violation , and the world wouldn't do anything about it , and george w . bush enforced what the international community refused to do . and again , he kept us safe , and i am forever grateful to what he did for this country . 
kasich yeah , let me let me just suggest to everybody , and i hear last february , i said we needed to have people on the ground in a coalition with europe and our allies . this is not going to get done just by working with the sunnis . and it is not going to get done if we just embed a few people . we have to go massively , like we did in the first gulf war where we destroyed saddam's ability to take kuwait . we need to have a coalition that will stand for nothing less than the total destruction of isis and we have to be the leader . we can't wait for anybody else . i served on the armed services committee for 18 years and we must lead , or the job won't get done , unfortunately , for our country 
rubio here's a guy that inherited 200 million . if he hadn't inherited 200 million , you know where donald trump would be right now ? 
trump one of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the republican party . millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting . they're voting out of enthusiasm . they're voting out of love . some of these people , frankly , have never voted before 50 years old , 60 years old , 70 years old never voted before . we're taking people from the democrat party . we're taking people as independents , and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it . it's very exciting . i think , frankly , the republican establishment , or whatever you want to call it , should embrace what's happening . we're having millions of extra people join . we are going to beat the democrats . we are going to beat hillary or whoever it may be . and we're going to beat them soundly . 
kasich the foreign policy , you have to know how to pick and choose . there's no way , if saddam had not had weapons of mass destruction , i would have gone , because i don't believe that the u . s . should be involved directly in civil wars . i opposed the u . s . involvement in lebanon . we ended up having to withdraw our marines after our barracks were blown up . there is a difference between iraq , where you have sunni , shia , and kurds put together after the first world war by the western powers . it doesn't work . it needs to break up into three parts . and for the russians , frankly , it's time that we punched the russians in the nose . they've gotten away with too much in this world and we need to stand up against them , not just there , but also in eastern europe where they threaten some of our most precious allies . 
trump ok , more energy tonight . i like that . laughter look 
carson well , first of all , let me say what i actually said about raising the minimum wage . i was asked should it be raised , i said , probably , or possibly . but , what i added , which i think is the most important thing , so , i said we need to get both sides of this issue to sit down , and talk about it . negotiate a reasonable minimum wage , and index that so that we never have to have this conversation again in the history of america . i think we also have to have two minimum wages , a starter , and a sustaining because how are young people ever going to get a job if you have such a high minimum wage that it makes it impractical to hire them . . . 
trump carl said , no , no but he's somebody these are the kind of people that we should use to negotiate and not the china people that we have who are political hacks who don't know what they're doing and we have problems like this . if these are the kinds of people we should use our best and our finest . now , on that tariff here's what i'm saying , china they send their goods and we don't tax it they do whatever they want to do . they do whatever what they do , ok . when we do business with china , they tax us . you don't know it , they tax us . i have many friends that deal with china . they can't when they order the product and when they finally get the product it is taxed . if you looking at what happened with boeing and if you look at what happened with so many companies that deal so we don't have an equal playing field . i'm saying , absolutely , we don't have to continue to lose 505 billion dollars as a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with china . i'm a free trader . i believe in it but we have to be smart and we have to use smart people to negotiate . i have the largest bank in the world as a tenant of mine . i sell tens' of millions of inaudible . i love china . i love the chinese people but they laugh themselves , they can't believe how stupid the american leadership is . 
rubio . . . go on my website , marco rubio . com . . . 
trump so i have nothing at all critical of him . 
trump are you going to apologize , jeb ? no . am i allowed to finish ? 
carson ok , well , first of all , let me just mention that last year at the naleo , the national association for latino elected officials , i was the only one of 17 republican candidates to go there . and the reason that i don't fear going to an organization like that is because the message that i give is the same message to every group . you know , this is america . and we need to have policies that are that give liberty and justice to all people . and that's the way that i have fashioned virtually every policy , looking at that . and i think that's the way the republican party generally thinks . we don't pick and choose winners and losers . we are compassionate . but real compassion is providing people with a ladder of opportunity to climb up from a state of dependence and become part of the fabric of america . when we begin to emphasize that , i think we will attract everybody . 
fiorina out a full page ad in the new york times to say he was wrong , i was right . i was a terrific ceo , the board was dysfunctional . and he thinks i will make a magnificent president of the united states . 
cruz ronald reagan believed in america . if i'm elected president our friends and allies across the globe will know that we stand with them . the bust of winston churchill will be back in the oval office , and the american embassy in israel will be in jerusalem . enemies across this world will know the united states is not to be trifled with . isis will be defeated . we will have a president willing to utter the words , radical islamic terrorism , and the ayatollah khamenei will understand that he will never , ever , ever acquire nuclear weapons . here at home , we'll reignite the promise of america . young people coming out of school , with student loans up to their eyeballs , will find instead of no jobs , two , three , four , five job opportunities . how will that happen ? through tax reform . we'll pass a simple flat tax and abolish the irs . and through regulatory reform , we will repeal every word of obamacare . you want to know what i'll do as president ? it is real simple . we'll kill the terrorists , we'll repeal obamacare , and we will defend the constitution , every single word of it . 
rubio first , let me say there are already women today serving in roles that are like combat . that , in fact , whose lives are in very serious danger , and so i have no problem whatsoever with people of either gender serving in combat so long as the minimum requirements necessary to do the job are not compromised . but , i support that , and obviously now that that is the case i do believe that selective service should be opened up for both men and women in case a draft is ever instituted . i think the more fundamental challenge we're now facing is what's happening to the u . s . military i've said this many times , and i think it's important to start paying attention to this . our air force is about to be the smallest it's been in 100 years . i'm sorry , in our history . our army is set to be smaller than it's been since the second world war , and our navy is about to be the smallest than it's been in 100 years . i think we need to begin to refocus on rebuilding our military because every time we have cut our military in the history of this country we have had to come back later and rebuild it , and it costs more , and it's a lot more chaotic and dangerous . when i'm president , we are rebuilding the u . s . military . 
kasich . . . to make ph centers ph of justice so that we can battle the radicals , call them out for what they are , and make sure that all of our people feel fulfilled in living in western civilization . . . 
trump . . . right . . . 
bush yeah . 
cruz you said , planned parenthood does wonderful things and we should not defund it . 
kasich . . . i'm very well aware of that .
