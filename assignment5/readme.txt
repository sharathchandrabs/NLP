Execution Steps-

Utilizing the links provided, kindly download the pretrained embeddings. Filenames after downloading have not been altered and have been used as is to directly load into program. The following filenames have been used,

→glove.42B.300d.txt  (Link: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) 
→lexvec.commoncrawl.300d.W.pos.neg3.txt (Link:https://github.com/alexandres/lexvec)

After downloading, run the file embeddings_glove.py to get the accuracy of glove model and file embeddings_lexvec.py to get the accuracy of lexvec pretrained embeddings model.
