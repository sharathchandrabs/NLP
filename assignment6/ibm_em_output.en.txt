With a skirt to measure the shifting much best that with a that not for of out , sticking , sticking in the waist , etc 
The body wear the can allow dress clothes with on , wear , wear or wear . 
There an many rates of figure in and of figure , to that I sort of that sort of all the week for to order in my head all this information .

The dressed we that them of the magazines or them in internet and them , for after them them . 
The expresses , that is as the called the result whole , as also our style personal and our to with the design graphic . 
It important also think in the part styling the styling . 
The stylist , by and , not dress only trendy , but that also the expect , by example , of the pages of products in the magazines ) of based creates , as Think , purses , trendy , etc ) . 
, , , we was the stylist and designer Mario Kameník .

The stylist has of have a vision global . 
The three guests from filled the lecture the Saturday with figure on , , of figure . 
The stylist Honza Pokorný , the designer of fashion Jakub ; and the photographer of fashion photographer ; . 
Jakub we recalled that the fashion is a illusion and the stylist should illusion be match to this . 
And a good stylist knows work with a it ways of dress of expressed in . 
The variability is , in this case , it . 
So , the on worn ) or as say in over , worn ) the can dress to the ; with worn and worn , but also a for dress the body worn with shoes of worn and worn as if worn in reality a as . 
Or well enough option and up the look for , a image completely different . 
&quot; emphasised with , &quot; , we relaunching . 
What that more following is the next Board : &quot; For need to work , for lack that first know all the rules &quot; . 
&quot; After , you start &quot; , said Jakub . 
the order I was clear by what drill all those drill , what the and with what , by what , if then is that in the magazines of fashion we we results often . 
That without to of the shows . 
is the photographer photographer , I that a stylist has that have more rates of clothes in the prepared of the that wants learned . 
So , for a history of fashion that on ten pages ) by and , ten ready ) , there that have ready , ten-page for said , the less achieved . 
And also that the taking the clothes One in combination with other clothes , all them different to the that the picture in the reality . 
end , there that consideration in a to the hour of creating the outfit . 
Honza Pokorný we said that the image and the style supposes them confirmed , in many cases , the half the success . 
Madonna look to turned , that not is her a singer extraordinary , but the image and the Strategy have to of she a star world . 
In Republic , by the at , not there still a trend clear to said the services of the stylist . 
far the it sufficient also the to redundant ) I believing my skills , my their physical not has at importance ) . 
And when someone we styling our services , there that have in a that is very to that we styling a styling very different to the lawsuits real ) than ) . 
After only was wrote and out if the magazines the nature , have written on the subject , if a to wrote has about / wrote , etc 
The Sunday , Honza and Mario we stressing in that the stylist not for enough stressing in the fashion , but that has that to of outfit . 
During his work , on , the must consists with the people to the that dress , by the that is it be a good Stylist . 
To stick to the people , not the for of less , stick their and . 
&quot; When a in you her for that for her the her and the the her with clothes beautiful , not you employees and from , the that had and to : &quot; her what her &quot; &quot; . 
&quot; pieces the less a few of things that pieces size and pieces for that someone the the can to &quot; , says Mario . 
He same also we that that , must duty in the called &quot; duty &quot; , is to , the exchange of work . 
This the is around of the waist and the have there all the tools necessary . 
are are as scissors , as scissors , pins , or pins . There also from of pins ) that for a the stylist during the in of taking of products such that purses or pins ) , pins special of pins of clothes by in , if this who the ) the pins and another , of pins not are pins , is could taking the pins ) , or a game of pins . 
For not we in the some practical and to something in from , we practical to sticking the soles of the shoes . 
Even during the shooting of taking in the study , in a surface brass , the could taking the soles and much more still the from . 
And not we more that sticking and sticking . 
not we play the shoes with the scissors for not avoid by accident . 
So that had that be very skill . 
Mario I has given a happiness the praising my work without reserves . 
The are is that not the I give very well those skills . 
This is only a small part of , the that we heard during , the order of week , in the second part the course . 
he I I given a that &apos;d the styling to level professional not is a a of realise , but I gives to no the that say the people . 
In Speed Speed Speed : The Run the takes by all America . 
Review 
A a , in beginning turned , the drive to out of a series of turned turned of a a turned during the a of morning . 
In to measure the a to the expectations , but , not a of nothing , if , in reality , not the ambitions do nothing extraordinary . 
The new delivery , to the that the title the this The Run , subtitled large expectations , before of his version . 
racing that units new For to the old series of races Speed Speed Speed and , to action of the shown , who as a game that not should to is another time a racing of action without more . 
also we disconnected curious by know how sections the scenes sections , where the character main sections the car and sections by his own to . 
As usual series in the series of NFS , the results not series great it in to the that we series . 
There races that the can give by a , but in the is total the by points to out of possibly decent , that , The unnecessary in the series from for years . 
In reality not the can , laziness mistakes , but that the is more well of the laziness laziness of the laziness . 
The adventure . very well . 
. you introduced in a history , whose participating , Jack , has certain problems personal ; for participating , the for offers participate in a race illegal by all America . 
task task the the in the on west , in San Francisco , and task mission is get the first to New York . 
The idea is offer something interesting . 
The route the into in ten stages and , then , in more of is races . 
, , the varied that each race has place by a route different and the stages are varied in often environments , that are is different and - . 
, that have , one not has , offering the of of that the game offering always the same . 
Some of the environments are even nice to the . , is the level technical the graphic is same the of nice previous of the series . 
the and , not is nothing the another world . 
But the in by the desert , the pleasant pleasant or the high mountains pools of is degradation a effect flight very pleasant . 
And , the races the untypical of time in when by a for untypical . 
So , by example , in the desert you seconds a significantly of into that significantly the visibility . 
In change , in the mountains there that have an for that not you careful a careful . 
According that , each a of the races is very well ordered . 
have there a few of models , but with that enough . 
During a at , try with to a amount of rival try ) the normal in a race location ) , after try of win time ) try ; try ) and then you a a try against a only you . 
In half of , this who to times the police , that not for but efforts still more the things . 
The new are the parts who the car . 
. most time time when Jack , in the majority of the cases , has of time of someone and you have that time , always time the time just in the at just . 
Nothing difficult . 
It would , without However , that in surprise less parts in the game of the that surprise expect ) in specifically there only three ) . 
But the result end is positive , because this for not does to be actually and , in the context , turns , is one of the elements that are that the game turns more interesting . 
The model of driving remains the prints of the no previous . 
That to to that to day of today , not is great it , but not the can negative that is bad . 
If simulation a simulation will , , you look in another part . 
But to a race Still with is action for even is this style of driving , is Still find something best between the games of the for . 
far here , , in order . 
But the problems come after of a , time . 
. difference of the collision of the models of driving , , not that the same with the is . 
, games of this , not but expect that deformations any and is complicated , but of to before of a on against any object , not you deformations how deformations your car , with the which not , is in order . 
It sometimes that , the do a sometimes very sometimes or sometimes the car with a car normal , so only in sometimes sometimes , but in other situations almost sometimes , your car has doing sometimes sometimes . 
Or even has completely crashed . 
is the system of enough , not come large problems , but can spoil of wrong not . 
The restarts are track of on it that , when track a accident or you track of the track , the game you track the last point of -- in the track . 
the However , in each race only the has of five restarts available . 
If the you all , have that you the race from the beginning . 
So is not is more that a a in case of that something not will well , but not is very of rely . 
. times , , the enough a , only a the heart the stage given of section . 
A great shortcoming the game is that the same facts the the in often places . 
In some curves , by example , there that into of a have specific ; of another have , are simply of a . 
seconds times you seconds in one site cars &quot; civilians &quot; always with the it seconds , is seconds the first , seconds or you five minutes before or after . 
This for of so on , in situations , when so that two cars that and the match in so so , your so so without problems , but when you , so around or well in . 
It no when you , because is occurs by that the &quot; to &quot; always occurs in of occurs nose . 
The competitors have also a The more . 
During all the game overtakes to places where , without have in a the at , always you overtakes the same you in the same site . 
And this that the end of the game , in a in bridge , the which is still more obvious . 
Obviously has must get before that you , the price that is . 
When will in of you , you he the vision of the cars that The of front , to that the beginning you do he the car . 
. can to the idea of it a game with it half of it and it , but the at is so it that not you it it . 
And is a pity , because is the model the a is you , the game is you and with action , of have that to often not is possible will the he the that around , where . 
And really gives no , if the It the , the idea with is or reason or the not in the race for that not reason the reason , or any another it . 
A idea unusual is the change of cars during the races . 
watch that be for to the watch of watch the the of the road , because fact there have that change of car , is in the great majority of the cases you watch the that have . 
The cars the divided in three categories . 
The ; are suitable for areas ; , the cars ; US for the ; ; and the exotic ; for a driving technical , by example , by ; of mountain with curves . 
And from mode main also who a from of challenges mode , is to , there races in places creates that mode by the stories . 
and both not only both , but also points of experience for your profile , that a and for the challenges as the both . 
the to the level higher , the driver the for unlock several chances , starting by the car and unlock with and for the profile . 
the same time , there reached a functionality reached in offline , that reached reached results with the of other players and reached other which community . 
One of the elements more difficult of to is how is from the last race in the history . 
With the car you until the do the underground ) &apos;s ) , where you do to do to dark by the in ) &apos;s ) . 
The from you brand between 150 and 200 km / from ) &apos;s ) and , of suddenly , by behind you does the from the underground and the you , by in without more . 
In the whether not whether a reject on this during several days , on if during the whether the game none when even a . or if the authors of are we when by a whether of whether . 
The part technical the game not is nothing extraordinary , but the less the effects visual he are in the majority of the cases nice , to times until visual . 
some what pity that , in the moments more some the it the quality of image and , in that , of a have serious . 
This especially on , to the accidents where there recoding many participants , when the quality of image with , not is recoding . 
The sound is well and the band soundtrack is a a of taste . 
. order of that is the &apos; to the the part the group &apos; , the band soundtrack is to the &apos; &quot; each one of his father and of his mother &quot; , but the can suggests that no &apos; the game only by his music . 
The of end of Speed Speed Speed : The Run is is is impression . 
If the game sincerely mistakes absolutely sincerely , we we problems in negative that The Run is the best game of NFS of the past years . 
this the of of that the game not , unfinished . 
The surely is surely , but surely because the mistakes you surely in the in with the strength of . surely of surely .

How have Trip the prices of the travel from 1989 
far 1989 had in the former of then only five agencies of travel state Čedok : Čedok , Čedok , Čedok , Čedok and Čedok . 
The agencies of travel of the at strictly in the majority of the cases travel only the block socialist , is the travel to West were very West . 
The tourists Czechs going , by and , of holiday to the go of the Bulgaria ) Republic Democratic ; ) , to the Union Soviet , ) ; in ; in the sea ; ) to Bulgaria and Romania ) both in the sea ; ) and to Hungary ) ; ) . 
A exception had was the period opportunity between 1962 and opportunity , when the could was to Yugoslavia , without However , after the regime opportunity the opportunity to the west and the travel of the tourists Czechs were then is West . 
A great paradox the socialistic was the to that to the citizens the block socialist ) or is , also to the socialistic ) not the to socialistic was free and individual , even by the countries specialists . 
If a an wanted was individual , by example , to Poland or to the Union Soviet , needed a letter of invitation , if not , the a as not was possible . 
The agencies of a some in those by also travel the West , but one the time to to the &quot; with a some of sleeping and was to all the night , or have &quot; good would &quot; in the agency . 
Still to not , was active . 
The called &quot; unreliable of change &quot; that was the condition for the travel the West , not the granted to the &quot; people politically . for &quot; , that to not could was in all . 
The currency ; not was a currency freely convertible and , without guarantee of change , not was possible , the resources ) the currency Western ) for was to West . 
The great majority of the Czechs survives their holiday in his own country , by the that had a great number of survives and survives of summer , that the Czechs survives . This at still habit . 
The have of was of the Czechs has experienced from 1989 a real revolution . 
While that until 1989 for us was the not will more was the holiday in the Bulgaria or Bulgaria , the year last the Czechs made 4.5 million of travel of holiday to countries of , the world . 
It popular great paradox , of the that today day , not are aware , the to of that the realise The favourite , Croatia , until 1989 not the could was freely , because popular part of the Yugoslavia of then . 
. and of the years 90 the initially the chiefly of requirements for was to the States neighbors of Europe Western , the that were a wave huge of visits of short-term on , chiefly to Vienna or Germany . 
The Everyone , during much time , not the Everyone Everyone of the Everyone the West , , the world wanted to the the less by a at . 
the example , in Paris tours the groups of Czechs in the tours in shops of campaign , , that our income of then not we tours pay a hotel or tours . 
A save typical of the Czechs of the time was the save save the food ) save , sausages , etc ) for which . 
Another at important was the introduction of the introduction of the crown Czech , to our tourists could finally , after of decades , buy freely currency Western . 
Our level of life which and with he also the wages media , the that around of 1997 were a increase in the suit of travel . 
With the increase of the suit of travel unbelievably the agencies , to be of 1997 with regular , to prepare the travel quantity the regular of flights charter , the that it order regular the prices of the travel in compared with the last , thanks to the possibility of , regular by the volume of passengers . 
. end of the 90 the century last , , the Czechs for without for to almost all the countries developed , for U.S. , the which for still more our travel . 
Another at interesting in the history the historically event The , in the 2000 , when was organized , thanks to a huge suit , the first flight an from Republic to a country historically , and was to Thailand . 
Since the year , warm all the years flights charter direct with tourists Czechs he countries warm and warm . This winter , the warm directly from Republic to 12 warm exotic . 
The countries exotic the Currently The near of 100 billion Czechs the year . 
Another at interesting of this period , that symbolising our development event , was in the year 2008 . 
The 17 of November of 2008 , U.S. removed the requirements for the tourists Czechs , with the that our country On to be between the countries more developed the world . 
In 2008 the Czechs , by first time in his history , have last more of the half of their holiday in the abroad ) per % ) and by first time in his history , the have than in travel the abroad more of 15 billion Crowns per by head , including the their in the site of per . 
Threat meeting General Threat for it the President , that could to of new in point Mate . 
Since for almost five months the football Czech is without President and is to that the successor of Ivan Hašek as president of the Federation Czech of &apos;s ) FAČR ) , not the exists , after the exists of the will meeting General exists that take place this Thursday in Nymburk . 
, to , still not the has it to a agreement on the rules of vote to will . 
the the start , not the there vote even for it between the three candidates . 
The www.festaacademica.cz to eager the football Czech are eager Rajchl , Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík . 
Hašek unite to his would in June not without before unite to their colleagues with the purpose of find a person strong that unite unite the football in the future . 
the However , after of this the was Hašek , the unable a controversy between the two chambers of the association unable of get to a agreement for &apos;s a candidate common . 
chosen was in was the 16 of September when had that be he the new President . 
The delegates of the meeting General the petitions in vain in the House National ) wasted wasted ) , wasted in the quarter wasted of wasted , because the talks the had sealed and not only in as the wasted of election . 
not the was to no consensus , in as to who in the meeting General had No to vote - only the representatives at or also the delegates with attorney powers . 
. be of that at and because to this only point , the thanks a agreement on , partially also by the recommendation the Institute of State and Law , according the which the representation by attorney powers not is possible . 
the However , the Arguments on the code election continue Arguments . 
Later at on the situation , not able regular , the Committee executive that , in their meetings , both or regular , its not by nothing . 
The opinion on the possibility of vote has changed a few of times , , but the point options remains is the same . 
The question is the next : ? of what to proceed in the third round for avoid the point Mate ? 
&quot; The Vice-Presidents tour in around to if the must proceed of agreement with the by-laws or find another model &quot; , says Vice-Presidents Svoboda , one of the three An of the FAČR , that , from the following of the association , represents the football professional . 
According the model Based in the by-laws , in the third round is the candidate that on the percentage of support in the he to the which present his for . 
The highest of Moravia is willing to get to a commitment for that can win the candidate with a the percentage total of votes in both chambers . 
The part stresses , without However , two-third the condition of that the winner , according these The stresses , looks have the majority of the less two thirds . 
&quot; This for two-chamber , without However , the sense to the two two-chamber previous and two-chamber by whole the concept of system two-chamber &quot; , to is as Svoboda understands the it of the part would , according the which the best would not play the order and vote according the by-laws two-chamber . 
With the would , surprisingly , is of agreement also Tomáš Paclík , is the of that the if election set by the by-laws of all the candidates even more to Pelta . 
&quot; I like that the maximum.&apos; the the of agreement with the by-laws &quot; . 
&quot; For that not the kinds no kinds about of the representatives as in the last meeting General &quot; , says the owner of I kinds , that the kinds by first time as candidate and that at their for mainly in against of Pelta . 
Pelta remains is an . 
According he , in Nymburk the will on the new President and he believes that the candidates in the future hopes of to hopes . 
&quot; stirring the stirring the stirring with the match of today of our team national in the Championship European . 
&quot; The football on to be participating , and to the on more to taste &quot; says the functionary the Jablonec , that of the three candidates has more experience in management the football , and to level professional as on . 
Rajchl is the more reserved . 
&quot; ambivalent that the an to a agreement , but , by ambivalent , the situation is much more very . &quot; 
&quot; not the is the &apos;s between adjustment and are , but there unsuccessful of purposeful the rules to his own adjustment . &quot; 
&quot; This can have as would a new blockage of the meeting General . &quot; 
&quot; , all increasingly , wins that the wins the sense common &quot; , said Rajchl . 
he not was much time for that all the parties is to a agreement . 
Some negotiations had that place in Montenegro , but ? who can know until that knows the match if the team of football be whole ? 
The order special , in the that had that was to An , between other the An An An and Rajchl , not has An this morning by problems technical in Prague , to that An a alternative for transport to part the committee executive the place where take place the match of not . 
ministry the meeting gain , by order , could be the that take place to level ministry , that , according warn , the will this Wednesday . 
. Josef force , minister of Education , force and force , for like much force to the parties force to the organisation Youth more strongest the country for that the an to a agreement . 
There much in game : the allowances state , the credibility the football and also the will meeting General the Committee &apos;s of the he ; the sports ) ČSTV ) that ČSTV ČSTV of a new following the sports Czech after the problems financial of the in of ČSTV ČSTV . 
Paclík Suitable by to the presidency , because not is a candidate more As . 
If the , of the players of Pilsen , Tomáš Head , before of the meeting General extraordinary Head the name of a candidate As that Head all their ideas on the new President of the Federation Czech of football ) FAČR ) , , the for as candidate to a because so relevant . 
&quot; If was a person in , emptiest on by she and not I for as candidate to the elections . &quot; 
&quot; But until the day of today not the has such find a person to &quot; , said Paclík for the Agency of found Czech ) ČTK ) 
What that motivation to Paclík to into in the &apos;s with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to the possibility of favourite to Pelta , the join winner of the elections , that try the a to the presidency of the Federation Czech of &apos;s ) FAČR ) . 
Paclík also is that , in case Victory , emphasizes in the would of President only until 2013 , when emphasizes the a of the meeting general emphasizes . 
In that would for like for to a expert and good manager that not , too like with the an connected . 
&quot; he I spoken with some people to the that could have in a &quot; . 
&quot; For me was a themselves I to some to that in this at , even they themselves with the football Czech . &quot; 
&quot; I like change that vision &quot; , this . 
What that for more is to Paclík in this at is the to of Pelta with the president of the association of football strongest of Pilsen strongest lobbyist , a man with a last controversial , known who the strongest as a powerful strongest with capacity of influence in the vote of the delegates in the meeting general . 
For Paclík is so unacceptable for to Pelta become in the therefore presidential . 
&quot; In case of that situation , the situation the situation force and nothing in the football move &quot; . 
&quot; With the support of harmful , a man of business harmful , the football harmful still less more &quot; , said Paclík . 
hinting also the to of that for . years the name of Pelta was is with a some phone during the research of a case of corruption , of the which Pelta is hinting . 
&quot; not I what prestige the football could prestige the victory of Pelta . &quot; 
&quot; And with what in we would the UEFA and the FIFA &quot; , said Paclík , that also more with to caution his statement previous that &quot; would the club Pilsen if Pelta the would in President &quot; . 
In the case of win the elections the Thursday , Paclík could imagine the cooperation with Pelta in the future . 
, it opinion is the another candidate , Rajchl , that has been supported by Paclík before of the meeting General of September that ended in a shared . 
&quot; He ) Pelta ) would the first the that go &quot; . 
&quot; It very he . &quot; 
&quot; I the could see , by example , as , of the representation &quot; . 
&quot; but not as manager of a association &quot; . 
&quot; don to understand the nose in where not I said he &quot; , added Paclík , that in September understand many , by a the &apos;s of the Commission of understand understand by understand understand , in after by understand understand . 
Paclík settlement that the dare to manage the association . 
triumph to their triumph of management of the companies private , is from the summer last is also the triumph the Pilsen , that with his support welcomed in May the he in first league . 
&quot; I strength for change some things in the voiced of football and environment to his from improvement . &quot; 
&quot; For reduce the influence of some groups of pressure , that likely tend to influence in the decisions the committee disciplinary and of appeal , limit situations nasty , said Paclík without e.g. their e.g. to the President the Sparta Daniel e.g. . 
A of the strengthening also would the of strengthening the to between the FAČR and the Committee strengthening strengthening , with the a the which strengthening pressure on the leaders political for that strengthening more money the sports of the taxes of the lottery . 
&quot; It one of the problems key the that the should attend the new President . &quot; 
&quot; If gambling the taxes on the games of gambling , as the gambling the parties political , gambling their arguments , but , gambling , have that gambling gambling will to was , this money &quot; , are . 
non-party , Paclík now not has in a even his association with the club does , is he same says that the president of the FAČR must be &quot; not non-party &quot; . 
Pelta is to his time is with Jablonec and Rajchl with connected of Prague . 
&quot; not is ideal . &quot; 
&quot; But not see sense the to of transferring transferring my shares the club of Pilsen to another person for then return in after a year and half &quot; , said Paclík . 
Pelta promised to the FAČR new by-laws that Would with the point Mate of the elections . 
Two days before of the meeting General of the association of football one of the candidates to the presidency , Miroslav strive , promised that , in case of be he , disputes that the FAČR for . new by-laws that disputes over for would , in the future , the controversies in as the if election . 
The functionary the Jablonec is an in as to the meeting of this Thursday in Nymburk , and believes that the &apos;s suppressed could by to a solution today with the possible victory the team of football . 
he before of the elections not gaining in September , Pelta promised focus , in case of be he , her in the representation and in on and . 
useful participate in the last minute in the last meeting general , by the that this useful of two months for could go well for two-month and present , in a context more A , their ideas on the management the football . 
&quot; The people of all the levels the expect the football , for much time and a his this Thursday the new president . &quot; 
&quot; feel that has it the hour of that someone connected the association &quot; , they the man that the feel mainly with the club of Jablonec , but that he in the Sparta and in the committee executive of the association . 
the this gives , believes have enough experience for manage the football Czech . 
reign He that behind of the problems current with the elections is the euphoria that reign in the period of Ivan Hašek . 
&quot; thought , in the meeting general of June were thought the by-laws that not were so thought as all thought . &quot; 
&quot; If representations representations representations , we a President , from September &quot; , warned Pelta . 
rewriting the rewriting the civil more important of the association rewriting the for as rewriting for her to the delegates . 
&quot; If I personal President , I the personal as a challenge personal and I take to as in case of that this personal . &quot; 
&quot; It a a of and , without the which not we fundamental &quot; , says Pelta . 
And , in try , that not rivals with their he . 
he in the last had recognises that the recognises recognises with Jindřich Rajchl , the that recognises by his formation in Law , is aware of that his has would also his first Vice . 
he she much time without attack to Thomas Paclík who , the a of Pelta , not did constantly with head . 
&quot; He more of a year in the world of football , and , has to some successes . &quot; 
&quot; Their attacks but were his and many people was his by the campaign election . &quot; 
&quot; the that many of them doubt on his be character &quot; , said to his proclamations Pelta , that remains is true to the some proclamations , in September . 
His weapon more strongest is , according he , his knowledge the football , from the sees more low until the sees . 
This last should be window of window the football . 
&quot; also , Í would all the Í that as to out of the Bohemians as would the scandal of corruption the year last . &quot; 
&quot; forty-six after I forty-six in the negotiations with the industry public and the private , for forty-six that in enough money for , the football &quot; , said for two months to the ČTK the candidate of 46-year-old years . 
. then also promised that his housecleaning as President the football not housecleaning no would personal of the personnel . 
&quot; employees that his first the tasks of each understandable &quot; , said series to understandable where , after a in period of understandable , learn a nervousness employees . 
. despite of the scenarios scenarios current that the scenarios in the will meeting general , he believes that the delegates not scenarios in vain this Thursday to Nymburk . 
&quot; If the only point of questionable will how vote in the third round , without doubt the questionable can . 
&quot; The football it credibility , the which the gain only if by order has a leader &quot; , still two days before of the gain more gain in his race of functionary , Pelta remains is an . 
Rajchl promises , that under his leadership , the FAČR Working to work with Once . 
If in the on meeting General is he the current Vice Association Rajchl as new President of the association of football Czech , many people the Association not Association . 
Rajchl promises that , in case of be he , the promises tough . 
changes changes a change changes and do that the members the committee executive are responsible of each area the football individual . 
also the ; to solve the case of the Bohemians , its the relationships with the UEFA and the FIFA , to more money for the football and continue with the work ; by the previous President Ivan Hašek . 
&quot; As President , I like &apos;d by whole the football &quot; . 
&quot; Since the contacts international with the UEFA and the FIFA until the youth , and by the football professional or the training of young players of high performance . &quot; 
&quot; With this not &apos;t to that the I , only &quot; , said Rajchl in a interview for the ČTK . 
&quot; I a player of team and &apos;t into the area the committee executive of on to that each member can competences to a area certain . &quot; 
&quot; And strictly tasks difficult for that the football can , in each one of those strictly , will forward with much impulse &quot; . 
&quot; . many people this likely not for would , because would need to work very tough and not only That the work of the others &quot; , added . 
supposedly to the escapes of supposedly in the movement supposedly , the says that has - the possibility of not made of new as candidate . 
&quot; All a , that work 20 hours day . &quot; 
&quot; But sticks know that this take sense and that not has people behind of my that I sticks and sticks to each step &quot; , explained to the be of his by . 
&quot; Many people I has would that not follow follow by mustn , because then the sequestration by mustn also the others &quot; . 
&quot; . is of have trust for not a to , without more &quot; , said . 
According say , for motivation also continue the work that , started with Hašek . 
&quot; During those two years , the ended a great part the work that not &apos;t that now the throw &quot; . 
&quot; f might that the had f and that will his effect as of a few of years and not I like that someone the f &quot; , announced may by the to of that , if f the another candidate , Miroslav Pelta , the situation in the association could return to be on as was before of the period of Hašek . 
&quot; don I in the order , and is something that , in my opinion , competent Pelta not is he of keep . 
&quot; would of he is on , all He people that the would the football for that who only a chosen for . would chosen . &quot; 
&quot; . I can subjective a be of things , but not the to of that I to for of someone . &quot; 
&quot; try be to . &quot; 
&quot; want do a football for all , because only to the everyone well all and not only the chosen &quot; , said Rajchl . 
he also the idea that only serious he the President . 
&quot; , some people try negative the a , I in try do the the by Moravia . &quot; 
&quot; the example , is hour of think in the to of into the second league in a part Czech and in another would , whose into into to the first league &quot; . 
&quot; not the units the situation current in the that we only three teams of Moravia , the that represents a problem for the players are young &quot; , said Rajchl . 
, to the joined of the elections presidential the by Tomáš Paclík , President the club does , Rajchl not help of believe in their chances of be he . 
&quot; still said have a strong support of the Federation Czech , the which I its as his Vice and that knows that behind of me there successes strong &quot; , said Rajchl , whose successes includes the passenger of the millions of million of Crowns of contracts includes , the negotiations of contracts includes and the negotiations on the law of the lottery . 
the another the , own his part of together in that the he not , partially . 
And while &apos; that Pelta is &quot; &apos; for regain the confidence in the football Czech &quot; , he the another to , Paclík , as a candidate strong that was has something that offer the football . 
&quot; No can doubt that it a great work by the Pilsen the year &quot; . 
&quot; In the case of that is he , likely present the that , started Ivan Hašek and not committees of to significant the personnel the personal in the committees . &quot; 
&quot; not &apos;t said that to my for &quot; , about to to their rival Rajchl .

The bank the scandal the Lake of Zurich 
The bank more risk-taking of Europe not the is in Italy , France , if not in Switzerland . 
The UBS almost in in from in the crisis financial and from then the bankrupt of a crisis to the next . 
Now the at a German . 
by that Axel Weber not the had role . 
After of his spectacular game of the with the bank federal , in July the from that in 2013 spectacular in a new and almost - of spectacular work : president the Board Chairman the great bank Swiss UBS , a spectacular and spectacular step in his race . 
Axel Weber the making he , for Switzerland by his beauty and to the UBS by his was solidity won and help fall for won on their future its . 
&quot; The UBS has to a turn &quot; . 
&quot; I making planning with working working and Oswald Grübel &quot; . 
In September was clear that , would completely different . 
A trader financial of the UBS in London prevented all the systems of security the bank and 1.7 1.7 billion million of Euros . 
Oswald Grübel , director general of the UBS , a banker not only known in Switzerland , had that going . 
The President the Board Chairman of the UBS the than from then - played , and all when : ? arrive does Axel Weber ? 
. from that Weber have advise the bank from February of 2012 . 
And the will would of the presidency the Board Chairman in May , not to and of 2013 , as the bank announced the Tuesday . 
This is tough for Axel Weber . 
not is banker , more well , professor of economy and adjust and has had a period of central not necessary . 
, on the for has of the strategy of a bank , that has of return to once that &apos;s the title &quot; the the bank the scandal of Europe &quot; from for time . 
the a part , the UBS is huge , until for . was the the manager of asset world , and by another part , from for years , the recently of a scandal the next . 
Nothing , to the seems , the for nothing the spared so spared bank Swiss . 
began the crisis financial . 
The UBS had a reputation excellent until 2007 . 
The image the manager of asset Swiss secretive and solid , but also combined , the combined with of ambitious , also wanted be a great number in the banks of investment . 
the a part , with managing billion of dollars , the UBS managing more money of clients wealthy that any another bank the world . 
And by another part , risen as bank of investment in the league of the large banks the world . 
This made . 
Hans Geiger , the former banker and The professor of banking in Zurich during many years explains : &quot; were my students , always I described to the UBS as model of a good bank . &quot; 
&quot; Since the point of . current , one the question : ? How could wrong ? &quot; 
was in a great error . 
In the year 2007 is to the at that something is very wrong in the UBS . 
. mid-October of year , Peter Wuffli , director general , that until then was - as a banker management and very highly , - surprisingly . 
Some months after , the why the reason . 
The fund of investment the bank the gambled in losses with securities of high risk and had that gambled billion of million . 
For believe with this , the UBS announced a believe of capital of nothing less that of 13 billion million of Swiss . 
For this found investors , sovereign that some sovereign with sovereign until . before : a fund state wealth and sovereign of sovereign and a fund state from , so secretive , that never the had but his name . 
This was only the first on . 
In April of 2008 , worse . 
The bank had that running the loss of billion of million , Marcel Ospel , President the Board Chairman , in 2006 in the second best running Board Chairman of Switzerland , - . 
In October of 2008 , a the catastrophe , in . of their investment saved , the UBS the found in the crisis financial in the from and had that be saved by the state . 
The bank national flames values from to the UBS by many billion of million , the Confederation untold he six billion of million of Swiss by a untold untold convertible , by the that the untold in untold the bank . 
recognised Switzerland was shocked , the said the dramatic that was this for a country small , if recognised to banks so large . 
was the sheet the balance of the UBS in 2007 was more of five times the that the results economic of Switzerland ) for styling ) . 
&quot; not we return to save to the UBS &quot; , said Geiger , expert in banking . 
. the first catastrophe the heels the second . 
potentially months after , the UBS potentially in a &apos;s tax with America and the that willing to declared the data of the clients wealthy , that to had potentially taxes with a the bank . 
And , repayment a for of repayment billion of million of dollars , repayment of which unjustified of these business with a UBS by payment . 
With , , the UBS accessory more or less have accessory in the fraud tax . 
secrecy lost something that had been from always his capital in the for by clients rich : the secrecy of secrecy . 
After the scandal , the being the bank Swiss , not is the same . 
. this then the then the President of the supervisory board and the President the Board Chairman . 
And the exodus of the and of the clients . 
, this to , in few months the bank lost his credibility in their two sectors its : in the banking of investment by the thanks thanks and in the administration of asset by the a the fraud tax . 
And just when things to be something more blades , just when the turn that the UBS things to turn , around this turn history the trader , a trader as 1.7 1.7 billion million of Euros , before of that the bank the turn a of that something was wrong . 
And the One , by the seen , this still not One well with the management of risk in the banking of investment . 
&quot; With the case incident the Janssen that the The of risk have changed too . &quot; , says Martin incident , professor of economy and finance in the Institute incident of the University of Zurich . 
The director financial of a great bank German also is is : &quot; The problem of the UBS is that not handle the The of risk &quot; . 
the the that not the idea of the caution , with the that the bankers Swiss the for from for time , be the republic of the in asset the world : no risk too big , in change , the security the money to republic the another the of the republic republic . 
The had of security of the banks Swiss were the symbol of the had had , as had and Sprüngli the had had . 
The &apos;s of the UBS in Zurich not still with the still the solid bank private Swiss , only is a . the . 
The situation is location . 
The bank has his headquarters main in the on surrounded of Zurich , that will from the station main directly the Lake of Zurich , surrounded by the surrounded pools of is of the mountains Swiss . 
and the buildings are shop , the shop are . of the more highest of Europe . 
and the to such as such between business traditional Swiss as the such Sprüngli . 
and resided from for years the banks Swiss : from the bank national , and by the palace of Credit Suisse , until the resided banks private as resided resided . 
. principle in the courtroom of revolving of the UBS by a onto door revolving . 
to the walls are sign of marble , in the to large behind of sign , and the logo the bank there a great sign for seem the &quot; security &quot; . 
The UBS knows the that the as for here : security . 
The two large banks Swiss , the UBS and Credit Suisse , in one at have point the idea the great bank Swiss , or the have ousted , as believes the President of a small bank private Swiss . 
prefer not see his name in the newspaper , the order and the about for , as all the bankers Swiss , also with the business of both large banks . 
The UBS the has to too big , believes , mainly in the banking of investment , where the Anglo-Saxons have active ground . 
opinion the Swiss not had nothing more that to . 
&quot; And the have they during much time to the they of the Anglo-Saxons . &quot; 
, to , the UBS was the banking of investment profits , profits his first great its and then from the disaster , no entity financial European had lost and money in the jungle the high risk as the great bank Swiss . 
The 15 of October of 2008 , the catastrophe was evident . 
&quot; That Wednesday the coalition a the small country of seven million decided the the operation of -- in the history of his nation &quot; , writes the author Lukas a in his book &quot; a a &quot; ) &quot; The a of the UBS &quot; in a ) . 
The political approved until 68 billion of million of Swiss or around 45 billion of million of Euros for save the great bank of the from . 
? How the to that ? 
. discussed with the bankers Swiss , to mainly the problem in the dimension of the UBS . 
In June of 1998 , two of the three large banks Swiss the consolidated in a powerful CEO . 
grow a bank that , because to the merger , was too big for the small Switzerland , and remains big . 
the the that served for that the two often banks wealthy of the UBS the wealthy : a bank wealthy but wealthy with the to of the administration of asset in Zurich and a wealthy more poor but more strong . 
, suddenly , the banks of investment wheel to of to wheel with much money , with the that could do wheel a great The financial . 
There two names are with this rise of the UBS : Peter Wuffli , , the CEO of the UBS of 2001 to 2007 , and Marcel Ospel , then President the Board Chairman . 
&quot; always dream that Wuffli and Ospel were a team dream &quot; , says the expert in banking Hans Geiger . 
&quot; Wuffli , the intellectual , understanding , that understands much of models and had , and Ospel , the understanding that a understanding step from the understanding in the bank until the with . &quot; 
was , Ospel the relied of Wuffli . 
And the end Wuffli ultimately likely a error ultimately : &quot; ultimately that their models were a reality &quot; , says Geiger . 
&quot; It a case tragic . &quot; 
Tragic , may . 
reign clear : The Pride was before the case . 
The employees of the UBS the repeated clearly of the meetings of of , in the that Wuffli , the , the CEO , always repeated the same motto : repeated the repeated to Goldman Sachs . 
The bank American was the bank of investment more powerful the world . 
that the &quot; league that &quot; , the that that then that the success of the banks . 
The UBS wanted be in the with . 
Some way for way well . 
In the operations of stocks and in the player of shares was in the more high . 
the However , the terms of companies terms by of power a point on : In the business the interest international , in the language of banking &quot; terms terms &quot; , there a UBS huge for the large banks . 
The UBS has its in the products mortgage US . 
For cost these its , the UBS started a adventure that almost for costs his hole . 
hedge of growth , hedge and the same bank as one of their and of high risk hedge in investment hedge of high risk . 
. - in a machine strongest for packaged loans mortgage US and packaged to then , packaged that risks to a own . 
And also , as other banks on the carried during much time . 
&quot; In summer of 2007 , as the market late American was in late , the UBS flames in &quot; , said Geiger , expert in banking . 
any big the euphoria , so greater the fall . 
A manager had that attempts , , that the attempt of attempts was more difficult of the that up . 
The jobs in the UBS the uncertain in uncertain uncertain and are uncertain until the now . 
now , who at a great bank , has a work almost impossible . 
be find a strategy for a bank , in the that all the models of business turned said turned . 
Geiger , expert in banks , has a idea , to order to the banking of investment , quit in the administration of asset , an to the roots Swiss . 
The bank not to get so far ) still ) . 
But the banking of investment must significantly much , is clear The . 
The next Thursday , Sergio Ermotti , the new President the bank , present his Tuesday strategy the world . 
In reality , only the when in the ways of 51 years as a solution ways , , that the bank the bank the ways surprisingly of his ways Grübel . 
proved , he the initially : be it of to permanently the business of the UBS , announced the bank of Zurich the Tuesday . 
Ermotti to mid-90s the bank of investment to his state to mid-October of the it . 
cutting cutting jobs . 
But this not enough . 
The UBS it a vision . 
? UBS is ? 
? With what to win money ? 
These are the questions that is the for Axel Weber The . 
far the at only says that first Publicly a flat with his woman in Zurich . 
The next year .

The Tuesday , the Committee of foreign foreign the Senate will to consider a resolution , sponsored by the President John Kerry ) Rep. by applauding ) , and with the senators John McCain ) Republican by Sens. ) and Joseph applauding applauding ) separate by applauding ) , applauding to the for by his successful rebellion and to the troops of U.S. by his &quot; their &quot; . 
&quot; This resolution is for rebuild to the courageous of Libya , the courageous to is his country &quot; , said Kerry . 
&quot; It a democratic of support bipartisan for their democratic democratic . &quot; 
The language can apparently may , but nothing on the debate on Libya has been easy until now . 
This summer , the lawmakers of both parties the wording between was and with the House White on the whether of a series of resolutions for approve or wording the role of the military of U.S. in the mission of the NATO in Libya . 
In June , Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution that authorizing the use limited of forces military of U.S. in Libya . 
The project of law was margin in the House by a A science bipartisan , and that never was to margin in the Senate . 
But the same day in that the project of law was an in the House , the voted also claims a measure that would voted the and for the operations US in Libya . 
upset did the mission of U.S. in a the of upset &apos;s - with the Congress the enough actually as for That the upset by part of Obama of the mission , but not so upset as for in reality upset the upset under their feet . 
. then , the by the Congress was overtaken by the an .

The resolution also &quot; irreversible the interest national of the States United in a successful and irreversible transition to the democracy in Libya . &quot; 
? split the new measure the whole support of the split of foreign foreign , or split to the lawmakers as it the project of law of June ?

Others lawmakers not have had success until the at for do get their amendments to the meeting , but not by lack of unsuccessful . 
The of Goodlatte is only a of the 68 amendments constitutional that the have spanning in this Congress , that spanning a is range of based . 
Some are slight - the same project of law the intends and in the House as in the Senate - and other with slight variations between was . 
There by the less 15 versions of the amendment the balanced budget so only in the House , and another handful that &quot; versions the expenditure federal . &quot; 
Some of those projects of law also are they between was , but give to their to - on , republican they that are they their they - the opportunity of they of that them were the &quot; authors &quot; of this measure . 
The Act of Strict of required , that was passed in August , required that and the House as the Senate required a amendment the balanced budget . 
In March , 58 senators voted to for of a resolution not supporting that supports the idea of that amendment .

Some lawmakers also want allow the two-thirds of the laws federal if are two-thirds by two thirds of the states . 
any offer that have been the members to the hour of offer amendments , not the are offer to a pace more as that in years previous . 
In the offered Congress , the lawmakers offered 77 shares , and introduced in in the offered . 
The pace is unacceptable in compared with the of the to of 1990 , when the members for regularly more of 150 amendments each two years , according figures regularly by the regularly the Senate . 
But not had much more success then of the that the have now . 
The last amendment that the added - the 27 - was ratified in 1992 , but of to was proposal by the Congress in ratified .

The troops are feel more pity that respect 
The event was a gala of Wall Street that homeless million of dollars for the veterans without Nonetheless in New York . 
helplessness helplessness sang a helplessness on the suffer , the helplessness and the loss . 
In that at , several hundreds of soldiers , sailors , strode and strode of strode strode in their jobs in around to he . 
The and of rose the - of to and rose . 
&quot; The men and women were servicemen as heroes &quot; , said David servicemen , who servicemen the fundraiser of and of spring . 
A officer military of high on in the gala , also known as the then President the State at then-chairman , the then-chairman then-chairman then-chairman , saw the role of the troops of to different . 
&quot; The involved as a the of by sort &quot; , wrote the officer in a sort sort . 
happy is of that the well they I well .

But not was respect , of are . It pity . 
The impressions uneasy uneasy uneasy the difficult to that the has representative of the military and a public American to often uneasy , to times , uneasy . 
. lavished to the troops with praise by their sacrifices . 
But the praise has a price , say the members the service . 
The public each time more Great as if for uniform pity those uniform . 
&quot; not are victims in all &quot; , said the general of brigade Sean Sean Sean , who commanded the troops in Iraq and soon leave to Afghanistan . 
&quot; But seems that the only to of that some supportive his support is supportive to us in the role of supportive supportive . &quot; 
The subject is a subject very sensitive for the leaders military , that not want apparently ungrateful or in questionable with the public the that or . 
also the give a of that the anger to the that the faced the troops that realize in the past years of the war of Vietnam was much worst . 
As result , the majority of the talks on the pity the have to about in privately and in private between the veterans of war .

The achievements in the field of and are rarely time chosen for the praise by part of a country that has little singled with the military and is few which direct of the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan . 
&quot; We , as nation , , not value the value military of ways that were the , common in the it War World &quot; , said the Lieutenant general retired David value , who commanded the troops of U.S. in Afghanistan .

The military Rape a Rape pressure for to with the rape 
This week , a hearing for will if 28 women and men have a case against the military by his landmark landmark in the rape . 
If not , hundreds of plaintiffs the are lining for the next . 
The soldiers of first Elizabeth Lyman had 25 years and 11 weeks of pregnant the night in the that she says that was pregnant by a team-mate . 
It October of 2008 , and the they of and to his at in the she Air she , the north of San she , after of the dinner with a friend when the found with a she that she a package of 12 she of she . 
He for questioned if could join to she in his her for a a join . 
&quot; went a flag of red &quot; , says Lyman . 
the However , the native of Texas did to a the his concern . 
thought , not , has 19 . 
&quot; It of Texas &quot; , says . 
&quot; I was heard to my I . &quot; 
. the few minutes of into in the her of Lyman , the man the for up by behind , raping to she and raping , alleges . 
This week , the 18 of November , Lyman and other 27 members the personal military current and former await await a decision court in a trial is that the will in await , will , that will if the suit that have decided against the await of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor , await Rumsfeld , as to trial . 
The suit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld within in the reduction of the rape shade between the military , in rape of the rights constitutional of the soldiers . 
attorney in February by attorney Burke , a doesn of Washington , attorney , the suit attorney initially to 17 plaintiffs , but &apos;s to 28 in the months following , 25 women and three men , all them can that were attorney or attorney sexually by their its , and that the military Cup to the hour of investigate , prosecute , or attorney justice in after of the attorney that . 
Burke says that will to by the brass the the military , because the problem begins with them . 
&quot; The military is a structure of top-down to she &quot; , says . 
&quot; ? retaliation are the people that are in conditions of leadership the culture of the retaliation ? The high put . &quot; 
Burke also says that from February , the have because in contactless with she near of suits survivors more , many of the which could be part of future claims . 
His strategy : In place of - to all the plaintiffs in this case , - all the - in a it - , by to - , will to present several cases , of be necessary , for keep the pressure . 
The team of the defence for the Department of Defense , Attorney by the tax federal Neil dismiss , has by a motion for filed the case . 
The documents the court , obtained by sued , sued the strategy of defence sued essence , that the military not can be sued by soldiers current or former by the for sued in the forces armed . 
the a is the Court Supreme of injury called the Feres Feres , the government federal not is has by the The injury by the personal in service been . 
&quot; The The incident are part the service military of the plaintiffs &quot; , say the documents . 
The Department of Defense the refused to do comment for this story . 
The things have changed from the years 50 . 
While that to the women still to is officially prohibited serving in combat , this serving is only serving : The wars serving rarely time have clear the lines the front . 
and in Iraq as in Afghanistan , the teams of women soldiers are zones roles each time more important , especially for get to the women local in areas of war . 
The result : between those two wars , 150 women soldiers have Mate and two thirds of them in situations of combat . 
It hour of that the military also the modernize , says Burke . 
She not is alone in his fight , and other three claims are in lost , also the lawsuits . 
In the at of Law of misogynistic , the misogynistic of Services misogynistic for Veterans is preparing a case against the four main misogynistic military by for misogynistic a environment misogynistic . 
the another part , the organisation without occurrence of occurrence Vietnam occurrence of occurrence is occurrence a suit against the military that the occurrence in the occurrence of &quot; personality of the disorder &quot; occurrence to the victims of rape with the order of to the is the service occurrence shown common , according the activists , as occurrence occurrence of the Red of Action of occurrence in Women , a group of rights human . 
His group presented a suit in December against the Administration of Veterans , practices of who practices in the it in that they the practices of which for the people that say have been practices sexually in the service . 
. have by nine projects of law by separate in the Congress by part of a a bipartisan of senators and representatives , separate a series of separate . 
In 2010 there Sexual that sexual assaults , according the quagmire for the Sexual of the Sexual Sexual and Sexual the Department of Defense . 
the However , the that are sufficient estimated assaults , and by the own estimates the Pentagon , that for in around the estimated by percent of the estimated estimated estimated that the that that year . 
The report , released in March , also rates the The of examines : in 2010 , a 20 by percent of the cases examines in the military was to trial - the half that in the system of justice examines . 
The plaintiffs in the case of Burke , traumas their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas . 
In the case of Lyman , occurred the reported rape to the police military less of a hour after of that occurred . 
That night , says , the for to that she the details of his rape 11 times fields to a and of she , doctors , and she . 
She the her to a her of rape , and the &apos;s of his - her a on in his her was her in his bed . 
Six months after , in April of 2009 , Lyman sex to a hearing in a judge , during the which the for questioned about of that was had relationships sexual with his boyfriend the day the attack . 
Six people witnesses as witnesses of disorder in name the alleged author , that was finally acquitted . 
&quot; remember the day in that the remember the verdict &quot; , says Lyman . 
&quot; thought that I was to go the work ran found ran from the courtroom . &quot; 
&quot; I by in the unit of saying , and when saying , saying that for I to my officer of put , &quot; &quot; That not was his trial . That was my trial &quot; . 
. Lyman the for ordered visit to a her military , that finally for her a personality of the disorder , the that the it not her for the service . 
In January of 2010 was preventing the service under terms preventing , the that for preventing receiving any benefit . 
In as to if the case by by Lyman and their its of suit at , is a possibility very moves , says John moves , professor of Law in the at of Law George Washington . 
the However , are , &quot; In my opinion , should be able of will forward &quot; . 
What that the stands between them and a verdict is this stands that has been was from that the on by first time . 
&apos;ve been a lifelong permanently of the Feres Feres . 
The military is decades by behind because not has the same posed and posed that for the they . 
And this : &quot; The &apos;s are heavily in against of them ... but is important for them odds . &quot; 
These things only change when the people good is willing to to . 
If the hearing not will by his a , Burke , doesn of the plaintiffs , lawyer to the &quot; to their other hundreds of plaintiffs for cases future . 
&quot; We to will on against the military in this subject until that the reform the occurs &quot; , says . 
&quot; Or until that we whichever , the that comes first . 
The walls have in : How the researchers you are Have in Facebook 
Before of but in the new face of the right-wing Right in Europe , Behring Behring Breivik was simply another , that guy their points of . guy in offline . 
The Monday , Breivik , who spree have showed a spree in Norway in July , that did 77 dead , the faced to his first hearing court public . 
While Breivik can have alone only , was far of be only in the alone : on last the the part the time that alone to his attack front to his computer , alone with some of the million of alone that support to the groups of right-wing in alone social . 
After of the tragedy of this summer , the researchers wanted know more about of these people . 
But , ? how find ? 
log - only to that into in Facebook . 
&quot; We tank a of that not was so difficult get to them &quot; , says tank Bartlett , author main of a report released recently on the tank digital European by the to of studies British DEMOS . 
The stash of information personal of Facebook is so stash , says Bartlett , that the researchers could simply use the tool of have for establish their been stash with with a for stash - the to that the - have state status during years . 
The team of Bartlett found half million of fans of the groups of right-wing in all Europe and then to ads ads , but in place of ads to a new band or product of diet , the ads ads to the users to ads a survey that &apos;s on his level ads , ads to the violence and the optimistically on his own future . 
the get to through of Facebook , Bartlett and their colleagues were able of study to more of out followers of 14 parties of right-wing Right in 11 countries European - , without ever of the office . 
&quot; It a it completely new of do a research &quot; , says Bartlett . 
Some of the results not are the , vexed : The supporters in offline of the groups of right-wing tend to be young , men and vexed by the immigration . 
the However , in a the of activism , &quot; those that activism his activism in offline with the activism who of offline are more activism , more activism and less activism that those that the activism behind of the with the computer &quot; . 
The work of DEMOS is only a example of how Facebook the is becoming in a new and important tool in hands of the scientists . 
trends of research , researchers doctors and scientists political are status the site for study , , from problems of health to Think social on as the trends in the &quot; I like &quot; , messages in the &apos; and updates of state . 
With more of 800 million of users active over a average of three pieces of content the day , the &quot; over of data &quot; of Facebook is over a wing of the research , over the number of operation over with the name the site in the title until almost a 800 % in the past five years . 
For some researchers , the beauty of Facebook is that you allows study to the people to the that not lets lets with a covering in the on . 
&quot; Before , when identify identify to people the Party National identify , was very difficult identify . &quot; 
&quot; allow that go to through the match , and them never you allow the access &quot; , says Bartlett . 
&quot; Facebook cuts , that - you to them directly . &quot; 
Others say that the site could provide a to of identify and to the problems of tackle . 
A study recent showed by the who were Moreno , of the University of were and their colleagues , found that the students university that were of their were of were in Facebook they a risk imbalance the of have problems with the were that the students that were in privately on the subject . 
Moreno suggests that the its of the students , such as the suggests residential , could control the site and intervene for help to a student that suggests suggests updates of state with their suggests . 
&quot; not can trying a problem if not the can &apos;s &quot; , said &apos;s &apos;s , the &apos;s of Moreno and director the Center of Health , &apos;s and Development the &apos;s in the Institute of Research &apos;s of Seattle , said the Washington &apos;s . 
&quot; kids found a to of identify children in risk that of another have not be kids . &quot; 
Facebook also is tapping &quot; tapping &quot; to his own population for , data . 
The voter of voter the site has champions had on the state of the to and the Day of San voter , the voter of involved election to half the period &apos;s of 2010 , and a at of voter National ) mainly status the information to the that the can get - voter of the freedom digital for much time that Stylist that the site should to to available of other his great amount of data for the research ) . 
the However , the users of Facebook a that the site to is watching , to watching or not - the &apos;s by power play the watching with a friend to billion of trade of distance is allow that the site watching your information personal . 
But ? what about when the users of Facebook become to form part of a survey that , even know ? 
While that the researchers have well-defined well well-defined on how their their data who of offline , in offline is a well-defined free for all . 
&quot; not I that many of the users at role even in the to of that a researcher could be walls their walls &quot; , says Neil Selwyn , a walls the walls of walls of London , on a study of 2006 that a to about with the &apos; public of Facebook of students . 
&quot; In the that to them concerned , was only between them and their friends . &quot; 
After is the a of the methodology . 
Even who of offline , not there guarantee of that a subject of research this is completely honest . 
In Facebook , is impossible know that part of the information the profile of a &apos;s and of the messages the wall are are . 
&quot; What that say in Facebook and the that you who of Facebook are two things completely different &quot; , says Selwyn . 
It by that that , to despite of their years as researcher of the technology , Selwyn believes that a clipboard and a pen continue is the best tools of research that no can use . 
&quot; not there real for into in the world real and to with the people real &quot; , says . 
&quot; The research social the of that is on the social - and a be of the social still around who of offline . &quot; 
&quot; Makes and Public : Behring Behring Breivik for his first appearance public in the court 
Behring Behring Breivik , the man that accessory be the brain of the two attacks that twin to 77 people in Norway this summer , the has described to was same as a twin of the &quot; resistance &quot; during his first appearance public in the court of twin . 
&quot; I a packed military in the movement of resistance packed and in the packed packed of Norway &quot; , said in a courtroom he with 500 people . 
&quot; I object the court , , that to the mandate of the organizations that support the ideology the hate and because supports the object . &quot; 
&quot; plead the facts but not I plead plead . &quot; 
The judge monologue Nesheim monologue to Breivik during that monologue , because &quot; not wanted give to Breivik the opportunity of use this hearing as a platform for that monologue their points of . &quot; . 
the the it reason the refused to allow to Breivik , that brought a speech written with pre-written , pre-written to the relatives of their victims the end of the hearing . 
Nesheim also ordered to the police keep to Breivik under tight during 12 weeks more , for tight the access to the media of from during four weeks , and said that the authorities tight that have a supervision control on all the visits and the tight during eight weeks . 
Some of 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended to the hearing . 
Some lock with the hope of look to Breivik to the in , other for confirm that the is lock under lock . 
All attended with the to of by to the closure . 
&quot; thought that Norwegian Norwegian and Public &quot; , said a Norwegian of Norwegian to the broadcaster survivor survivor Norwegian Norwegian . 
&quot; was uncomfortable , but for me was a step forward after of for and I the on . &quot; 
throughout with a swimsuit a and throughout into , Breivik the a throughout and professional to the in of the hearing and looked to the journalists and to the survivors to the in when in and is the building . 
. despite of the larger notion of Breivik of be part of a movement of &quot; resistance &quot; the , the judge determined that not is a larger not , and said that not there there of that larger with accomplices . 
It possible that to some to radicals that the attacks the 22 of July may be work of a radicals in place of a group of radicals . 
But that not doesn doesn the Sorrow and the doesn that all a nation still feels . 
&quot; I like that he a doesn , but not the seems &quot; , said a was of a victim . 
&quot; It much more easy if the he . &quot; 
7 Week of the interview Lost of Steve Jobs , the show in a Week this week 
After the death of Steve Jobs , the 5 of October , there some that the tech with Jindřich tech - tech the genius of the technology as the Great tech tech . 
But the that the fans of Apple could find more referendum , in a interview to Jobs recently workflows to the that the has workflows as workflows of a series of workflows special in the in markets this week , is workflows workflows this try workflows about of the might business and most of work of the products . 
was without doubt a designer , dreamer and tweaker tweaker , but also was a &apos;s tweaker and a tweaker of the tweaker of flow - a man that brings that many tweaker tweaker &quot; a sick that is in think that a great idea is the 90 by percent the work ... &#93; but &#93; there a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product . &quot; 
In 1995 , Bob Cringely was was the series of television The rare of with Nerds ) The he of the rare ) on the rare the computer personal , and the rare during more of a hour with Jobs for a an and rarely conversation . 
In that at had last adoption 10 years from that Jobs had been adoption to adoption of Apple , and , adoption hard in his new company computer adoption , been the convinced popular of Internet . 
While that a small part of the interview of Cringely the used in Nerds , said that the original of the interview shipping during his for . 
was only after of the death of Jobs that the copy a garage complete in copy in the copy the director . 
This material of re-edited , slightly re-edited , is the is of Steve Jobs : The interview Lost , of 68 minutes , that does to the re-edited re-edited this Wednesday and Thursday . 
For someone known by philosophies the on in on , Jobs here seems surprisingly take to eager their philosophies awarded and IMB business . 
And very thoughtful . 
In four points different to the in of the interview , there large thoughts between the questions and the answers - of 10 to 15 thoughts of thoughts , where Jobs is weighing clearly their thoughts , - for . 
also there moments in the that the subplots of Jobs is to the surface , where seems subplots because to the questions of Cringely , subplots to go more as to the based or arguments of the importance . 
prescient before of the was of prescient , the prescient or the iPhones , there something prescient prescient in The interview Lost , when Jobs about the that is that other companies are well and wrong , and offers his own vision the future of the computer . 
A it is see on &apos;s of the race of Jobs , but there something &apos;s and &apos;s in the Jobs that &apos;s here , the dreamer &apos;s the on of the greatness . 
He has a vision of as can and must be the things . 
not much after of spelling , with he here , was and the it . 
A as right of seven sequences of of The interview Lost : 
On how run to to a business : 
&quot; . the in of the years in the business , I always &apos;s : &quot; &quot; ? the what you things ? &quot; and the answers that you give of it invariably are : &quot; invariably , that is only the to as the for &quot; . 
No knows by what for the that for , in the business no they in the things very they . 
That is the that found . 
Jobs , the he their efforts for simpler the streamline of Apple . 
variance by the it in the variance the costs - to often starting with a &quot; cost standard &quot; that the he to eye of good variance , and that then the variance with a &quot; by &quot; - developed a variance variance that ensured that could establish the costs business the he . 
On the pranking the Pope : 
Jobs recounts the &quot; Blue Blue &quot; that he same built with Steve Wozniak - a an that that to the people recounts recounts the company phone and do calls to long distance recounts . 
. has written widely about the an , but the euphoria of Jobs here the act the Blue Blue as a ceremony of widely is widely . 
describes how he and Wozniak as the on by the use of a phone public , doing a called , and then as from a network of as &amp; as to another , while as a as with the the amount of as possible . 
&quot; pay pay the things around the world a average dozen of times and pay to through the phone public and things a minute more evening the phone public of the door of the the &quot; , says Jobs with a pay . 
&quot; learned young and the that learned was that we build something us same that could control billion of million of dollars in infrastructure in , the world . &quot; 
We two , not &apos;t much , but we build a it small that could control a it giant - was a lesson incredible , and not I that ever was &apos;t Apple without she . 
Jobs at ringing a pranking ringing that he and Wozniak almost ringing , ringing the ringing to through of the Blue Blue in half of the night and ringing to with the Pope , while he his best ringing of Jindřich ringing . 
. measure that several members of the various various were players in half of the night for to with the various American , the two various in various just before of that the various Pope who awakened for go to various the phone . 
On falling of the technology ) and the those by phone with Bill Hewlett ) : 
. the age of 12 years , to the in of pieces of counter for build a counter of more , on to Bill Hewlett in the spare phone and for it a called . 
at after of his conversation phone of 20 minutes , Jobs a a employment of summer to time on in part-time . 
&quot; That was a treated influence on me , was the only company that had seen to that age and treated my vision of the that was a company and the well that treated to their employees . &quot; 
Jobs the &apos; after in one of the employees of HP that labs the labs of research of the company in labs labs , where saw &quot; the first computer of being ever to &quot; . 
It so big as a suitcase , had a small with of pipeline suitcase , and I fell of he . 
write a a until HP as write and monthly the time with that machine and write programs for she . 
On improvising the innovation : 
In several points of the interview , Jobs discussed about of talks new products on the lost . 
he in his race , , that the he to sell a handful of he is , for questioned a as if could he , the team . 
figure with only 30 days of credit , had that out the assembly and the delivery of the to figure . 
Later evening , while was in Apple , he the struggles to the that the faced in the development of a mouse of computer : 
&quot; I agreement of have arguments fed ... I fed that the fed five years &#93; for it a mouse that fed 300 dollars &#93; , and I fed and I went who and found a designer . 
reliable days after , had a mouse that we build by 15 dollars and that was completely for . 
On the large companies steam strength : 
their before of that their the their of Apple , Jobs their their the it in that many leaders of the industry their in his vision , and their the control of his share of market . 
&quot; so that so in IBM or Xerox , by the that you so and so best , ? and what ? &quot; 
you has the have of the share of market , by the that the company not has more success . 
The purchases of sales and running &apos;s the success , by the that are this who of people the that running by it the companies and the people running of the products are running the forum for the more of decisions . 
The genius of the products that a to that position of have the vs. by together of people that not have the notion of good products vs. vs. products - the knowledge the vs. necessary . 
That is the that On in Xerox ... 
Xerox could have seized of all the industry computer . 
90s have been ten times his size , could have been the Microsoft of the years 90 ... 
grabbed the defeat of the victory . 
On the innovation as expression art : 
&quot; There a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product ... to measure that evolve the great idea , modifies and grows . &quot; 
. subtleties much about of the subtleties of the it . 
There sacrifices that to that do - some things that not can do that you the you , the glass the for , the you the are , the factories the are . 
fitting that keep fitting things in your brain - these fitting - fitting all to the time ... 
the end , the it the taste - the comes to and comes to the best that a team of human has to , and then trying of comes those things to the that your comes doing . 
steal said that the good artists steal , the large artists steal . 
player we had stealing about of stealing large ideas . 
What that in part it big the who was that the people that were working in he were who , who , artists , who , who , that who were the best scientists who the world . 
If not who by the computer , could be doing things would in other would . 
Scalia and Thomas takes with the rival of the law of &apos;s healthcare while the court with the case 
The day that the Court Supreme the it to door closed for feted the a politically improve of if feted the &apos;s to the law of &apos;s healthcare the President Obama , two of their justices , feted Scalia and feted Thomas , were at in a dinner sponsored by the firm of law that feted the case in the high court . 
The occasion was the last Thursday , when the nine justices the petitions in a hearing conference for study met the pour of review . 
One of the cases in a was a suit sweeping by 26 states sweeping the reform total of the &apos;s healthcare passed by the Congress the year last , a law that has been a sweeping of war for the activists conservatives in , the country . 
The justices swing argument to ex the suit and , of to , the a a swing is of 5 hours and average for March , and the result likely swing still more the race presidential of 2012 , that be in time &apos;s in the at in that the decision the court the swing . 
The lawyer that thrown in the court and thrown that the law must be thrown will likely Paul Clement , who served as tax general of U.S. during the government of George W. thrown . 
The firm of law of Clement , sponsor sponsor , was a of the almost two dozens of companies that helped to sponsor the dinner longstanding of the Society Federalist , a group that , many years sponsor to the defence of the and sponsor conservatives . 
Another firm that trade the dinner , Jones trade , represents to a of the trade business that trade the law , the Federation National of trade trade . 
Another sponsor was the giant stake stake sponsor . , that has a huge interest financial in the result the stake . 
The dinner the welcomed in a hotel of Washington , hours after of the hearing conference the court on the case . 
, the aides was , between other , opponent opponent , the Republican more important in the Senate and a proclamations an of the law of &apos;s healthcare . 
? The guests special in the dinner ? Scalia and Thomas . 
not is nothing new : The two justices have state attending to events of the Society Federalist during years . 
And not is something that between in &apos;s with the rules runs . 
, to , the justices are governs the Code of governs that exempt the shares of the justices federal lower . 
If not the they , could they that they under the Code they they , that says : &quot; A judge can they to events for on and of organizations an with the law and other , is the judge not can be a they , a they of honor , or they in the program of on event . &quot; 
the However , the sheer commissioner of Scalia and Thomas to two of the sheer of law in the case , to as to a company with a huge interest financial , was enough for sheer to the activists of proximity in the government . 
&quot; This judges breach of the proximity and indifference to the code will in against of the claims of several justices that judges the court by the start rules that the by to all the justices federal &quot; , said Bob Edgar , the President of judges judges ) judges judges ) . 
&quot; The justices were at in a fundraiser of and of gala with law that have cases wining in the court . &quot;

&quot; A -- so big , -- of this to -- , I that the the part of our projects -- and of construction not the cannot -- - not the can buy three -- parties of a ship or a building - and taking damage other efforts of modernisation &quot; , wrote Panetta to the senators . 
&quot; also we separate forced to separate to many of our officials civilians of it separate and , because to that the reduction the separate with at quickly , is almost is that we that separate civilians with the order of to the to . &quot; 
&quot; The changes readiness the trust with those that year our military and readiness damage the good available . &quot; 
The cuts with the time hit to the troops of combat , said Panetta .

As spot a lying 
A pervasive to the headlines more recent we at pervasive serious and pervasive are the deception and the lying in the life daily . 
The candidate presidential Republican Herman Cain is further side unjust of harassment sexual with several women ; each part side of lying to the another .

In a day studies , the studies show that you can lying in any place of 10 to 200 times . 
That is , many of those lies are lies white . 
Another study that that the Unknown meeting three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting . 
spotting lies , or &quot; the spotting of lies &quot; , is a skill spotting that an spotting all , by reasons and personal as professional . 
from of be a game of being similar to , by example , universities , where the to is universities : &quot; object I &quot; , the detection the deception is a universities the knowledge serious based in data scientists obtained during the last six decades in universities universities that universities projects of research in on , especially in universities and universities . 
One of the results of the research is that the Buffett result about of the lying have been myths . 
The liars was Liars to the in .

The good liars have the skill of see well to the others , them feel to taste , them their own with and them of it them how the them the others .

The people that might also can said a language entirety : &quot; not entirety relationships sexual with that woman ... the Miss Lewinsky &quot; or repeat a question difficult entirety . 
The indicators verbal more common are subtle . 
Someone can said a be of &quot; language as &quot; when as to a question difficult : &quot; as ... to to are ... until the that I the ... to my to . &quot; 
This for that the response is a renders in place of a to and is to often a flag of renders .

? Park or mountain ? 
The architects change in the opportunity of the exists more beyond of fees on fees 
The competition municipal on the 16 doors reopened the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona 
height of the 80 , in time &apos;s of the , height height Metropolitan of Barcelona ) MCB ) , this Administration height . height of window of Collserola . 
The metropolitan metropolitan the mountain as the great park of the Barcelona metropolitan . 
It more , the accompanied of a compared , in figures , with the Central Park accompanied . 
With the death of the MCB , in 1987 , the park was to ​ , in the ​ of many , as the limit higher of Barcelona , is the capital ​ of the few that not the ​ in the also ​ but top-down ) mountain ) ​ ) sea ) . 
The rating of Collserola as park natural redounds in this idea . 
The reference , not was Central Park but wild , with the wild in the role the wild wild . 
In these the was until that , in September , the council composed a composed a by 16 contests for other many doors of access to Collserola . 
A door refers to the idea of park , without doubt . 
Or that or someone wants to doors the field . 
The question is alone : Collserola , ? park or mountain ? 
The competition , and by his side side its as by the that of of its on the city is the subject of conversation between all the architects Barcelona . 
It almost , a subject make the that themselves hand when two members of this old themselves of chosen the themselves in a themselves . 
And this to gives to , fact , to a of the few precisely between the that are three architects Barcelona , and been university , that the have by . 
Miguel Roland , Daniel Modolo and appropriate Bayona : the competition is appropriate . 
For Roland , after whenever the front approaching &quot; the for necessary &quot; rule on &quot; the front of mountain &quot; , all time that the speech of whenever whenever , the of the whenever whenever , not the has was to about . 
&quot; It be of the is of that the park more largest of Barcelona is the beach . 
, other things by his great accessibility . 
Collserola is more complex &quot; , is the architect for who the title of &quot; doors of Collserola &quot; we a &quot; we we &quot; : not there that think in them &quot; as the we to a park , but the delimitation of the areas where there that act &quot; . 
Modolo , as Roland and Bayona with experience in the world as , dangers the proposal of &quot; challenge intellectual &quot; with &quot; some with &quot; . 
song limiting of the &quot; uncertainty that is today day song the space public &quot; after the experience stronger in the 80 and that had in the area the song &quot; his uncertainty the song &quot; . 
The first fear is the own delimitation of the is on where the can build . 
&quot; overcoming something is overcoming , the next step &quot; , is to , his overcoming . 
&quot; There that think in new of urban , of planning , because the current &#93; in reference the urban General urban ) urban ) &#93; can give to to urban to &quot; . 
Later ​ to the question , Modolo believes that , ​ , the side ​ of Collserola &quot; can ​ as a park , the of Barcelona , not &quot; , by a a side ​ . 
Modolo he that , there a work to by the profession of Collserola that &quot; not must fall in some is &quot; , is profession the opportunity that the council offers to his profession of intervene in this project &quot; from the first at &quot; . 
And still more , understands that the he of the mountain with the city is the he that allows to the architects into in the debate , but &quot; doubt &quot; on if is this profile technical the that must he the teams he ) &quot; , a he &quot; , questionnaire ) that the have had that it : &quot; The architects he be only a tool &quot; . 
Bayona suggests that the response to the question that gives title to this piece is suggests , because in the leaves the competition lack a vision global of Collserola : &quot; . have suggests 16 contests suggests suggests in the sense suggests , but not there a reading suggests , that see and suggests the area in his is &quot; . 
chosen to , the less in his case , that in leads by participate in the 16 contests . 
, another have , a project for a of the doors can definition in program and definition with the the architect of the door of the the . 
In his opinion , that was , the council should provide that the into immediately higher to the smooth of smooth should smooth , in all his smooth , a area of smooth that smooth a equipment transition between the city and the smooth .

finding announces protocol for MSS gene of obesity 
directs the by Social a research for people the gene of the obesity in children and young ; is supported in from the specialists 
The Institute Mexican the by Social ) MSSI ) announced that at a research for people the gene of the obesity in children and young , called protocol &quot; conducts of the obesity of the childhood and the conducts &quot; , that be now with markers conducts the overweight . 
In a statement , the , of the Unit of Research Medical in Medical the Medical of Medical the Center Medical National Medical Medical , Miguel Cruz Lopez , explained that the Medical a team Medical of doctors , Medical , Medical and Medical social .

In the research the invites to participate to the population is or not tests , going to the units tests participants the MSSI in the Valley of Mexico , where the have to about the there to the children , all the Saturday to be of the 8 : 00 hours . 
unit that the protocol started in the Unit Mexico unit ) State of Mexico unit ) and that from the 8 of October , the activity the , to about in the Unit Mexico unit ) State of Mexico East ) .

Cruz Lopez said that this research gain to the concern of the professional of the health by the alarming increase of weight in the children . 
&quot; The only of health of 1999 and 2006 between that in so only six years there a there , in the case of the children , of 77 by percent in obesity , and of the Health of Surveys by percent ; in terms of overweight also the observed a 47 dramatic &quot; , stressed the specialist the MSSI .

avoid of the UNAM come potholes 
Rafael Herrera , researcher of the at of Chemistry of the UNAM , developing asphalt asphalt with produce for produce a a with best performance , regardless of the conditions environmental and of temperature 
If the with that signals the pavement is signals , not would necessary repair near of 200 billion potholes each season of signals in the were Metropolitan the Valley of Mexico , warned Rafael Herrera be , researcher of the at of Chemistry ) CF ) of the UNAM , who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of a pavement signals is the As , the potholes could signals in amount or , even , signals by whole . 
In his lecture A opinion technology of the potholes , polymer in the he the polymer International of the Chemistry , he to his that the responsible to his would developing asphalt asphalt with produce for produce a a with been polymer to the the asphalt , but with a the resistance mechanical , and to high as to low temperatures . 
Herrera be used that this , of asphalt asphalt could hot in places where the weather is extremely hot , as some cities the north the country , for its his performance and , by the and , the formation of potholes . 
explained that the asphalt , the part more onto the oil , is a is of molecular of molecular , the of high weight molecular , calls molecular , and other of under weight molecular , calls molecular , that which for give the pavement his molecular behavior viscoelastic . 
The behavior viscoelastic the asphalt is in that to high temperatures , near of the fragile degrees , the behavior as a fragile , to 120 degrees consists his fragile is very is and to 50 degrees consists has a state almost solid , while that to temperatures very low , the asphalt the at fragile , added . 
What previous means that in the that the resistance the asphalt not is engineering , but that the will engineering during the day of agreement with the conditions environmental and of temperature , warned the specialist in engineering uniform . 
The researcher of the CF observed that the that of the streets of Mexico in his majority are pools by pavement flexible , the which the streets of six layers of material , of the which the last three streets the asphalt . 
, the layers more superficial the is the covering asphalt , superficial by small superficial superficial in asphalt and then superficial . 
compose a of the compose that is the covering , said , is Each with asphalt . 
the vehicles the cars and vehicles efforts , vehicles allows that the forces the vehicles very well in the pavement . 
If the it of asphalt it the it still best , said the manufacturer it . 
On the covering asphalt , ​ , the is a last layer called covering of rolling , the which is from of a material of stone ​ , is to , a into that also the ​ in asphalt . 
As the is of the layer that will to be in contactless with the wheels of the cars , must have more strength mechanical that the covering asphalt and provide friction in the a . 
the be the part the pavement that will to receiving and consideration the efforts , the covering of rolling requires , also , have the thickness As and the must receive the material the that is from . 
The weather , especially the humidity and the variations of temperature , also are a factor very important to consider , in special the water , said , because especially are the performance of the covering asphalt . 
When the ground the wet , the water the wet in the of of the covering and is difficult that get , this wet a wet of all the layers the pavement and , by the and , the formation of potholes . 
In the process of formation of a signs , said , the first in wear is the wear of wear and only after the especially the covering asphalt , but the damage not that wear , but that is a process that should wear to the first with with suitable programs of maintenance . 
The also member the load National of load explained that the burden load is another factor important in the formation of potholes and , by , , the thickness of each a of the layers the pavement must go always in to with the burden load and provide that the load , for avoid that the load potholes be . 
Rafael Herrera warned that still there much that investigate and work on the asphalt , by example , the emulsions emulsions , that in other countries , the to even in the market and do repair the potholes with already and without need of said high temperatures . 
? What for lack to the candidate the Valley for be the new Miss Colombia ? 
affected of the factors that affected for that Melina Serna Serna not affected the crown of Miss Colombia . 
The Valley gets his title number 14 of princess . 
, new the Valley the Cauca the was with the Once of the crown of Miss Colombia . 
This time Melina Serna Serna the had that winning with be in the winning of winning , winning the crown of winning and the band that the winning as new princess of Colombia . 
With the result obtained night in Cartagena , where the Miss she the up with the crown and the Garcés , the department , sheet 14 securities of Princess and Melina the a to the Garcés of women Garcés that have state near of the crown but that were Garcés Garcés between them Garcés Garcés Garcés ) Garcés ) , Garcés Garcés Garcés ) Garcés ) , Garcés Garcés Garcés ) Garcés ) , Garcés Alvarez ) 1981 ) , Garcés Garcés Garcés ) Garcés ) , Olga Maria Garcés ) 1987 ) , Garcés Garcés ) 1988 ) , Monica Garcés ) 1989 ) , Maria Garcés Garcés ) 1990 ) , Garcés Garcés Garcés ) 1993 ) , Garcés Garcés Garcés ) 2000 ) , Garcés Garcés ) 2007 ) , Garcés Garcés Garcés ) 2008 ) . 
Now the great question that many the are is ? What lack ? 
Because the result represents the defeat of a great missing that in each presentation missing that she had , for be the new Miss Colombia , not in vain was missing Queen of the their and missing missing missing of missing , securities that missing queens as missing Vargas or missing missing who the were the crown of Miss Colombia . 
The first factor that the he key in the decision that took the jury of ​ &apos;s Princess she in that not ​ with his response to the question &quot; ? ​ is that book that you has her to ​ and by what ? from by ​ ​ Gomez , of the ​ ​ ​ . 
the questioner the she responded : 
&quot; pretty much , I is in the literature , I that is a it of culturalization , over I that the book that I that of childhood is &quot; The little &quot; , is a book is pretty . 
now read &quot; read and ; &quot; , is a book of literature universal that all an see ; and today in day I read the book of read read , a Russian , a book read that the called &quot; The read of the &apos;s &quot; &quot; . 
A response that . anxious first by the for &quot; culturalization &quot; and second by not explaining of to specifically of what to each one of the books that cited the have her . 
But the telephones the ceremony Melina said it it and happy with the result &quot; the it is it about the that has that was . 
And for all the people , by for &apos; a &apos; , &quot; The little &quot; is a great book &quot; 
, the hypothesis launched the says that to Valley the part the launched . 
A journalist traditional traditional that the be the traditional , the traditional and the candidate that the she all the fact preliminary ) challenge of traditional traditional , vote the public by the best swimsuit traditional , and Queen traditional ) , &quot; that subtitled the traditional of the other traditional , traditional to the awards and by that not traditional in the for &quot; . 
And that the that in his first presentation in swimsuit of her in the beach the coronation and their two shows in the coronation of coronation . 
, in both she improvement , the that that for appeared the strength and the she that the representatives of she and she was she . 
wins wins , journalist the program &quot; As in in &quot; , the Canal wins said that the to of that Melina who wins princess &quot; wins that the candidate that more fact wins during the competition not was as awards &quot; . 
And , Valley the that to the last very lately with the press , and there the lately . 
Another hypothesis is that Valley not was ultimately the jury on his interest to the work social , that is in last , the essence the Beauty National of Contest . 
the something , two days before of the election the jury international Lucy seeking said that them seeking a woman seeking with the to social of his seeking . 
&quot; The beauty alone not enough in a must Colombia , there that look on beyond of the physical and focus in his must social , that before of must the Beauty said , must in projects &quot; , explained . 
also the beauty that Valley sinned by their sinned in the sinned and the fibrosis that the for as in his fibrosis , but is sinned is her the jury the its as the candidate &quot; Contest natural &quot; with the body more healthy , good food and work physical has . 
The noticeable of queens Jorge noticeable noticeable own that Melina not had the best body , that had best , &quot; but his problem of fibrosis in the fibrosis , that the are for my not was very noticeable , for , points in the last day &quot; . 
, and the journalist surgical surgical , of the magazine surgical he that the error of the she were the interventions surgical that the surgical . 
&quot; The surgeries are well , but Valley not the the knew do . 
His body never was his strong and here the the punished &quot; . 
the this patents , that by first time delivery the Beauty National of the Contest , after the prophecy in swimsuit of her not a prophecy prophecy that night the was , is the said that this was the prophecy that prophecy for granted to Melina for not it the taste of the crown . 
reign or not , the , is that Melina from today . a year of reign , not as sovereign , but as princess , position that for reign the possibility of represent to Colombia in one of the reign international by appointment the own Beauty National . 
the However , she overwhelming to the history as a of the queens that to despite of his overwhelming step by Cartagena , for was lately the crown . 
So was the work the identified that the the body of Alfonso Cano 
A lophoscopist of Cali On to the history as the man that confirmed the death of &quot; Alfonso Cano &quot; . 
The work of these officials is key .

The What the fraud in the low by sick 
After the allowances , the UMP and the government launching a offensive against the low by sick . 
Nicolas Sarkozy be the Tuesday 15 of November in recurring for visit a on has of the allowances relatives and fund a speech on the subject , , make from 2007 , of the fight against the fraud social and the recurring . 
And , for economies on offensive , that part of the to of which of it this , but still to he to a also of the campaign presidential of right-wing , the majority to focus in the low by sick . 
In first place , for implement cuts unemployment : the government unemployment benefit to the workers the industry private a fourth day of employees before of power employees the with . 
In pay , to that equal a an of company specific , a without that lose larger monthly four days of monthly , is to , a lose the 15 % of their income lose . 
. is of a measure that could produce a wave of anger , but that would which which million of Euros , according threatens threatens . 
And , had wait of another measure with a , more wait : benefit to the officials a day of employees without for in case of with leave ) until the at , not have employees , front to the three days that the by in the industry private ) . 
While the are these an , the majority at to to on the being - the subject the fraud , this time are to the are of the low medical . 
&quot; you to you are the The and , also , if the discovered to someone you a fraud , have you the have &quot; , warned you you on in the you the Sunday 13 of November . 
the no that in the other cases , the effects the announcement appear slightly disproportionate for the reality the fraud in to of low medical . 
, to , from 2002 the by a monitored has of this a and the have This in offensives political that , know , have given offensives . 
The French not sicker more that in the rest of Europe . 
look with , , in first place , the figures about . 
According the Institute French of the security social ) CNAM ) , in 2006 the nationale more of nationale million of Euros in nationale by low medical . 
According the Institute French of research and de in economy of the health , the allowances by the low de , in 2008 , the 5 % the expenditure health , de to de million of Euros . 
, this sheet , the 46-year-old % Municipality to the low by at and by accidents medical , while that the at % is like with the low by sick , for that millions to at million of Euros . 
the therefore , the 2,5 % the expenditure in represented . 
In 2010 , the French have days a average of Consulting days of with leave , front to Consulting in 2009 , according a study the group Consulting Consulting . 
A average that , without doubt , taken taken : another survey , taken in 2007 by the Syrian of management professional taken , taken that the 75 % of the taken taken French questioned taken that not had days , a only day of with by sick . 
Another study , in this case of the lasted lasted , at that in 2010 the 37 % of the low by sick had a on than to 8 days , the 22 % of between 8 and 14 days , the 15 % of between 15 days and a month , the 15 % of between one and three months and the 11 % were more lasted . 
If the those with our neighbors European , the workers French not are more those that in other areas to employees low by sick . 
A in study showed in 2010 by two researchers the absence absence that , between absence and 2001 , the rate of absence global the work ) and by reasons of health as of another , ) absence , in France , between the 10 % and the 11 % , front to a 20 % and a 28 % in Denmark , a 15 % in absence absence or between a 16 % and a 18 % in the Netherlands Netherlands . 
The fraud in the low by sick not is especially significant in compared with the work not an . 
The fraud has a , is limited . 
The for of the legislation , from 2002 , has is that the The of the low by sick of more of 45 days are strengthening . 
In 2008 , of 1.5 million of equal , the CNAM controls , in a 13 % of the controls controls , that the low of short-term on were &quot; controls or too controls &quot; , is to , controls cases . 
In the case of the low of more of 45 days , controlled to equal controlled , the than that the 11 % of the cases were &quot; controlled controlled or unjustified ; a for that , to as game a total of In million , millions to controlled . 
the therefore , the with a total of 169 cases &quot; unjustified &quot; between several million of workers that 169 a with by sick . 
the doubt , a for represents in compared , by example , with the work in black . 
According the deputy of the UMP shortfall shortfall , author of a report on this a in June , this from shortfall the losses of income tax of between shortfall and shortfall million of Euros the year , is to , more that the cost total of the allowances by low and , without doubt , are more that the fraud in this last voiced .

foreign energy : 
the facts must prevail more that the dogmas 
If there a subject that not the can trying to in a via of be long-term or simply via in the with , is the policy energy . 
The availability and the cost of the electricity affect directly in the power cost and in the competitiveness of the companies . 
It As that a match election is the at of stakes on such an and on the place of the energy nuclear . 
The debate it unless fruitful if proposed the is of the consequences economic , social and environmental of the choice proposals . 
The French must rational his opinion in facts of , in data rational . 
Now that are electricity million of people in the will , the by unless electricity the electricity of the suit unless before of electricity , to less that the electricity to a huge part of the population world of a for vital . 
the same time , has that vanished the vanished each time the of the resources vanished for will limit electricity vanished , without from the vanished need of reduce the emissions of forgetting of effect vanished for to against the change vanished , a subject that has vanished the debate vanished . 
The accident of Fukushima not parameters none of these parameters . 
the that , Germany is alone in his decision of is to the energy nuclear . 
That not is the case , of Belgium , that modern the lawsuits to the need of find a source he of modern , , of Switzerland , that it has by to build its of last replace . 
the another the , Great Britain , quote , Poland , Republic Czech , Netherlands Netherlands , Sweden , South , China , India and Brazil , by instant some quote , continue forward with determination with their projects . 
The States United , by his the , after Fukushima decided range a unit to his park , decided the construction of a &apos;s resuming after the accident of Three Three Island . 
If the model German , based in the quoted renewable , the has in that as example , the reality will in against of on speech . 
The election of on will to suggests a rise the price of the electricity , a the increased energy by the need increased of gas increased , in particular of Russia , a increase of the emissions of dioxide by the construction of its of gas and of due . 
In . months , the these the effects these . 
be considered on the case of Denmark . 
it of Europe in the industry it , the which its the 30 % of his electricity , also is one of the large users of due and of gas because to the it the wind ; by this reason , their emissions of dioxide and the price of his electricity are , one , a 65 % and a 50 % more it that the average European . 
the the a , thanks to the constancy of our policy energy , our neighbors subscribe a constancy of electricity a 40 % higher to the of the households French . 
While that in a economy worldwide the cost of the energy is a factor key of the competitiveness and a guarantee the maintenance of the worldwide industrial in the territory national , the companies French the worldwide of the electricity more worldwide of Europe . 
the that reason , any reduction significant of the energy nuclear would a strong rise the price of the electricity , the that re-industrialisation realism to the would some on the re-industrialisation of our country and the defence of our power cost . 
. is of a price that the great majority of the French the form to pay and , of to , not Reservations opposition by beginning to that , of energy , according show the only . 
should that the policy energy of our country has lost build a industry industrial with 000 jobs of work director and 000 jobs 000 . 
specialised are to the specialised , which a specialised of specialised specialised in the markets international and that can it jobs not specialised . 
If France sacrifice a the energy nuclear , would the &apos;s of great part of those sacrifice and the loss of the helped million of Euros sacrifice in exports French of sacrifice and services nuclear . 
? What sixty sixty a EPR designed for work sixty years , when is by the heroic of his its ? 
For would the solve of the energy nuclear , there that argument that not there a source solve of production of electricity , the no that to there a source solve . 
The development by part of Areva of solutions with low emissions of dioxide , nuclear and renewable , complementary the character emission of the and of energy . 
In the case of the energy nuclear , is vital keep the the level of security . 
In France , intransigent of a intransigent of security that intransigent a control supervision and transparent and on the its existing as on the construction of generation . 
Our teams , of safety-related professionalism , are also safety-related by the security . 
In half century , the industry nuclear has experienced three accidents serious . 
any only one , the of Three Three Island , the thanks in the conditions operating occurred ; not were consequences , for the people , for the half environment . 
In unforgivable , the accident the At the design the unforgivable and to . possibly human unforgivable . 
In Fukushima , some people appear from that the accident the At to two unprecedented unprecedented of a , without unprecedented , that which the death of millions of billion of people . 
The industry nuclear predecessors of this accident , on as the it of the two previous . 
is to these progress and to a cooperation between the authorities of security , and the step and constructors French and German , the EPR has a design he of resist to such step . 
While the construct all the construct by that they build a &apos;s , the continuation of his construction in generation would a great have for the competitors of Areva and construct , because that to construct a free for at the leadership in the construct development the industry nuclear . 
It essential and legitimate look the best choice partisan for our country , but would partisan to that the portion , the dogmas and the partisan partisan partisan a debate so important for the situation economic , social and financial of our country . 
The immigration , ? a burden or a opportunity for the economy ? 
The policy of immigration as by Nicolas Sarkozy has been was status from different points of . : the status of the services police , legal and and from to the policy of figures , the status of this policy with the status status of &quot; country of the rights human &quot; of France . 
Later recently , is the harassment Chairman of the students foreign the that has waiters to the headlines , with the minister of and ) waiters the newspaper waiters the 23 of May ) waiters of last that France &quot; not it talented foreign , waiters , waiters &quot; . 
the However , rarely time the investigated from the point of . economic . 
The a is that , on this subject , there is consensus between the Left and the Right . 
In the case of the Right , Jacques misery by the misery misery in 1976 that &quot; misery unemployed not should be a problem for a country that a with near of two million of workers immigrants &quot; , while that in the Left , the tone the by misery misery misery that France &quot; not can &apos;s would of all the misery the world &quot; in 1990 . 
The only difference , the degree of generosity 
In 2005 , and the Left as the Right on the fear to the on the territory national by a and of on on . 
. both on , the he that the immigrants are a burden for the economy and the society French . 
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with the that resides with in to the immigrants . 
In his program , François saying the his to to saying , saying that the saying be would the &quot; problem of the migration &quot; . 
This idea of the immigration as a burden , a problem , it is electoral electoral , but economically is very face . 
Maybe as Our the which Our Our and Our Cameron in a work recent that Our the knowledge more recent on the immigration ) Our Our : Our Our Our Our Our book Our Our Our Our , May of 2011 , Our Our Press , is Our . ) , there a A consensus between the from on the impact positive of the most real in the growth economic , the wages and the employment in the countries that habits immigrants . 
The harms of the immigration leads the growth and converted the employment . 
The replace are with the impact of the immigrants the are in the idea of that these can unskilled to the workers about , in particular to the . ones , pressure for that the unskilled their wages . 
But the experience complementary that , in reality , the immigrants are more well local that are of the workers about and local mainly local in sectors with lack of employment . 
The immigrants . ones are in sectors that not skilled to workers about and the more ones in sectors skilled where the formation not linked the suit of personal . 
A effect positive on the wages 
On same have that a locals locals difficulties for work in a country that on lack of locals , the locals between about and immigrants to that the arrival of these past locals locals in the wages and the employment of the about . 
of in a the previous , Giovanni real real that a increase the 1 % of the most real of a rise of the wages real to in long-term of between a Industrial and a decline % . 
And , without have in a the to of that the whilst that are the immigrants into to the creation of ideas and the growth economic ) there a great whilst of fact Nobel US whilst and companies as Google , prizewinners , whilst , whilst and whilst were proportion by immigrants ) . 
The immigrants also are contributors contributors to the systems social , because that are of average a 1 % the budget total in the countries European . 
The for International the to by , by example , that in Germany a receipts that an with a age of 30 years arriving a of net ) income less their ) of arriving Euros to the budgets public of average during all his life . 
the beginning of his mandate , Nicolas Sarkozy wanted go to look the points of growth that for wished &quot; with the teeth &quot; . 
serve teeth , that serve to the immigrants , had to the effect serve . 
Europe invented the democracy , only for lack think in a democracy European 
The democracy is a well precious , but also precious . 
The continent European should power tragedies of , , that , is the invented in Athens for more of two billion years , to the in the century XXth has experienced the tragedies of the War World , tragedies , the tragedies , the tragedies , but also to tragedies in Spain , to Salazar in Portugal , the tragedies in Greece . 
Some it as that , for that the democracy as over on their enemies , would enough to the vote and the have more an possible .

The suffrage universal , is the is of a condition to for the democracy , not is enough by was only and even can but in a &quot; become of sine &quot; , as said and the sine Republican sine sine . 
not , the democracy requires much more : a space public , a spirit public , values , a organisation , a separation and a control of the powers , a education , separation , solidarity economic and social , justice . 
The crisis that primarily in Europe is a crisis economic , but is to point of but in a crisis policy and democratic . 
The worrying the worrying Greek worrying had , to this in , a double effect referendum : that the need of a and that of the that policy , but also the decrease of of his worrying , of his worrying .

The are is that the lines the front of the and democratic The the have point and that , in many cases , the soldiers republican , not forefront in the good sense .

A firm in white the &quot; European all or a high the into the &quot; &quot; : ! what choice for the an ! 
not , not want be serene of effect , but a exercise common , of time No , blades and thinking , of the choice and the democracy , this time to level European . 
not there crisis in Greece , Italy , Spain , Portugal ) of to , not enumerating where to the list ) , because only there a crisis , the crisis of Europe . 
The entire of Europe is the that the suffer to the orders of the markets and of the agencies of rating , that the that suffer his suffer and his lack of solidarity . 
It the is of Europe the that is a scene in the that international . 
We about by the its of sovereignty to Europe , but is all Europe the that some is the sovereignty and , with she , each a of their nations .
